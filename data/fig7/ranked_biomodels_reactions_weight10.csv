They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should use the replacement table and any references to make it more precise.\n\nLooking at the example they gave, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, it seems like if the term is a receptor (R) or ligand (L), I need to prepend the specific molecule\'s name, connected by an underscore.\n\nThe replacement table they provided has two entries:\n\n1. For `pRSKn`, the name is also `pRSKn`, and there are no references.\n2. For `ppERKn`, the name is `ppERK(nucleus)`, and the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3.\n\nI need to map each `id` to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with `pRSKn`. Since the name is the same as the id and there are no references, maybe it\'s already a clear term. I should check if it\'s an abbreviation or a specific molecule. If it\'s just a shorthand, perhaps I can leave it as is because changing it might not be necessary.\n\nNext, `ppERKn` is named `ppERK(nucleus)` and references MAPK1 and MAPK3. ERK usually stands for Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase, and the phosphorylated form is often denoted with \'p\'. The nucleus location might indicate its state or location. But the references point to MAPK1 and MAPK3, which are the same as ERK2 and ERK1 respectively. So, `ppERK` is a form of ERK, which is a MAPK.\n\nI think the term should reflect the phosphorylated state and possibly the location. Since the name mentions the nucleus, maybe it\'s indicating the active form within the nucleus. So, combining that, I could have `ppERK_active` or `ppERK_nucleus`. But the guidelines say to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore. Since the name specifies the nucleus, perhaps it\'s about localization, but the state might be about activity. Alternatively, since the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3, which are active forms, maybe `ppERK_active` is better.\n\nWait, but the name is `ppERK(nucleus)`. Maybe I should include \'nucleus\' as part of the term. But the JSON needs a single word, so I could use an underscore, making it `ppERK_nucleus`. However, the references point to MAPK1 and MAPK3, which are active forms, so maybe \'active\' is more appropriate.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is about the nucleus, perhaps the term should reflect localization, but the references indicate activity. I\'m a bit confused here. Maybe the term should be `ppERK_active` since the references are active forms, and the name\'s mention of nucleus might be a location, but the main point is the active state.\n\nPutting it together, I think the best approach is to map `pRSKn` as is because there\'s no reference to change it. For `ppERKn`, since the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3, which are active forms, I should map it to `ppERK_active`.\n\nWait, but the replacement table for `ppERKn` has the name as `ppERK(nucleus)`, so maybe the location is important. But the JSON needs a single word, so including \'nucleus\' as a suffix makes sense. So, perhaps `ppERK_nucleus` is the way to go. Alternatively, considering the activity, `ppERK_active` is also possible. I\'m a bit torn here.\n\nGiven the guidelines, the name should be prioritized, so `ppERK(nucleus)` suggests the term should include the nucleus. Therefore, the JSON term should be `ppERK_nucleus`.\n\nSo, the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""pRSKn"": ""pRSKn"",\n  ""ppERKn"": ""ppERK_nucleus""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe the user expects the references to influence the term, so using the MAPK references, perhaps `ppERK_active` is better. Alternatively, combining both, but that would make it two words, which isn\'t allowed. So, perhaps I should stick with the name provided and include the nucleus as part of the term.\n\nYes, I think that\'s the way to go.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input, there are three ids: species_10, species_11, and species_26. Each has a name and references. \n\nStarting with species_10: The name is ErkActive, and the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3. Erk is a well-known abbreviation for Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which are MAP kinases. MAPK1 and MAPK3 are the gene symbols for ERK2 and ERK1 respectively. Since the name is ErkActive, and the references point to specific MAPKs, I can map this to a more specific term. However, the guidelines say if the term is already interpretable, don't change it unless necessary. So, maybe I can just keep it as ErkActive, but perhaps adding the state. Alternatively, since the references are specific, maybe combining them. But the guidelines suggest using the name first, so I'll stick with ErkActive.\n\nNext, species_11: The name is ErkInactive, with references MAPK3 and MAPK1. Similar to species_10, but inactive. Again, the name is clear, so I'll map it to ErkInactive.\n\nThen, species_26: The name is PP2AActive. PP2A is a phosphatase, and the term is already specific. Since the references are empty, I don't have more info, so PP2AActive seems appropriate.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that sometimes a two-step process is needed. For example, mapping id to name first, then refining with references. So for species_10, the name is ErkActive, but the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3. Maybe I should consider the full names. MAPK1 is ERK2, and MAPK3 is ERK1. So perhaps the term should be more specific, like ERK1_active or ERK2_active? But the name is ErkActive, which is a general term. The guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so I think it's better to keep ErkActive and ErkInactive as they are.\n\nFor species_26, PP2AActive is clear and specific, so that's fine.\n\nSo, the JSON would map each id to its respective term as is, since they are already biologically interpretable and the names are clear."", ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

But if it\'s ambiguous, I should use the replacement table and any references to make it more precise.\n\nLooking at their example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, when the role is a receptor or ligand, I should connect the abbreviation with an underscore. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them as part of the term with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided. The equation is Tgfb_I + MMP2 => Tgfb_A + MMP2; Tgfb_I, MMP2. The replacement table has several entries with the same `id`s but different roles.\n\nLet me go through each `id`:\n\n1. Tgfb_I: In the replacement table, the `name` column is empty, but the references say TGFB1. So, I need to map Tgfb_I to TGFB1. Since it\'s in the reactants and modifiers, I should think about what state it\'s in. The \'I\' might stand for inactive, so perhaps Tgfb_I is the inactive form of TGFB1. But the guidelines say to use the `name` column if possible, but since it\'s empty, I should use the reference. However, the user\'s example didn\'t use the reference directly but combined it with the role. Wait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"". So maybe for Tgfb_I, I should think of it as the inactive form of TGFB1, so perhaps TGFB1_inactive or something. But the guidelines mention that if the `name` is empty, I can use context and references. The reference is TGFB1, so maybe Tgfb_I is the inactive form of TGFB1. But the user\'s example used the `id` part before the underscore, like IL6_R. So maybe Tgfb_I would be TGFB1_I? But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, maybe Tgfb_I is the inactive form, so the term would be TGFB1_inactive.\n\nWait, but looking at the output example the user provided, they had ""Tgfb_I"" mapped to ""TGFB1_inactive"". So I think that\'s the way to go. So Tgfb_I becomes TGFB1_inactive.\n\n2. MMP2: The `name` is empty, and the reference is MMP2. So since the `name` is empty, I should use the reference. But since it\'s the same as the `id`, and the guidelines say if it\'s already interpretable, don\'t change it. So MMP2 stays as MMP2.\n\n3. Tgfb_A: The reference is TGFB1, so similar to Tgfb_I, but \'A\' might stand for active. So this would be TGFB1_active.\n\nSo putting it together, the JSON would map Tgfb_I to TGFB1_inactive, Tgfb_A to TGFB1_active, and MMP2 remains MMP2.\n\nI should make sure that each key is the `id` and the value is the biologically interpretable term. Also, each term should be a single word, so I\'m using underscores to combine the base term with its state.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach based on the guidelines and the example provided.']","['TGFB1_inactive + MMP2 => TGFB1_active + MMP2; TGFB1_inactive, MMP2', 'TGFB1_inactive + MMP2 => TGFB1_active + MMP2; TGFB1_inactive, MMP2', 'TGFB1_inactive + MMP2 => TGFB1_active + MMP2; TGFB1_inactive, MMP2']","['kactTgfbMMP2*TGFB1_inactive*MMP2', 'kactTgfbMMP2*TGFB1_inactive*MMP2', 'kactTgfbMMP2*TGFB1_inactive*MMP2']","[True, True, True]",46.0,14.131329890586187,2.7506961411921815,39.0,1.1305584907531738,2.8243008801267404,5.0,0.18484126031398773,2.8450047580906195,11.25,2.8354203835187604,3.0,3

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the IL6 receptor, it becomes ""IL6_R"". Similarly, for ligands like ""L"" connected to CSF1R, it becomes ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nThe user mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. So, first, I map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then I refine it using the references provided. That makes sense because the references might have more specific terms or contexts that I should consider.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term, connected by an underscore. For example, if there\'s a term like ""active ERK"", it would be ""ERK_active"". But if the term is already clear, like ""pMEK"", I shouldn\'t change it unless necessary.\n\nLooking at the input equation: pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK. The replacement table has four entries. Let\'s go through each one.\n\n1. **Reactants pMEK**: The id is ""pMEK"", the name is ""pMEK"", and the references mention MAP2K1 and a BAO ID. Since ""pMEK"" is already a common abbreviation for phosphorylated MEK, and it\'s consistent in the references, I don\'t need to change it. So, the term remains ""pMEK"".\n\n2. **Reactants ERK**: The id is ""ERK"", the name is ""ERK"", and the reference is MAPK3. ERK is a well-known acronym for Extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and MAPK3 is its official name. Since ""ERK"" is concise and widely recognized, I\'ll stick with ""ERK"".\n\n3. **Products pMEK**: Same as the reactant pMEK. The term is ""pMEK"" and it\'s consistent across references, so no changes needed here either.\n\n4. **Products pERK**: The id is ""pERK"", name is ""pERK"", and reference is MAPK1 with the same BAO ID. ERK is usually referred to by MAPK3, but here it\'s MAPK1. However, since the name is ""pERK"", which is a standard abbreviation for phosphorylated ERK, I\'ll use that. The reference might be indicating a different isoform, but without more context, ""pERK"" is the appropriate term.\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to create combined terms like ""IL6_R"". All the terms are straightforward abbreviations that are already biologically interpretable. There\'s also no mention of states like ""active"" or ""bound,"" so I won\'t add those suffixes.\n\nDouble-checking the guidelines, I made sure each term is a single word, used the names from the replacement table, and didn\'t make unnecessary changes. The JSON object should map each id correctly without overcomplicating the terms.\n\nI think that\'s all. Time to put it all together into the JSON format as specified.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK. The replacement table has four entries. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Reactants: pMEK, id is pMEK, name is pMEK, references include urn:miriam:bao:0002007 and MAP2K1.\n2. Reactants: ERK, id is ERK, name is ERK, references include MAPK3.\n3. Products: pMEK, same as reactants.\n4. Products: pERK, id is pERK, name is pERK, references include urn:miriam:bao:0002007 and MAPK1.\n\nSo, I need to map each id (pMEK, ERK, pERK) to a biologically accurate term. \n\nStarting with pMEK: The name is pMEK, which stands for phosphorylated MEK. MEK is a kinase, specifically MAP2K1 as per the reference. But the name is already pMEK, which is a common abbreviation. Since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it significantly. So pMEK should stay pMEK.\n\nERK: The name is ERK, which is another kinase, MAPK3. ERK is a well-known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Again, the name is ERK, and it\'s commonly used, so it\'s better to keep it as ERK for clarity.\n\npERK: The name is pERK, which stands for phosphorylated ERK. The reference points to MAPK1, which is another ERK isoform, but the name is pERK. Since it\'s a direct abbreviation, I\'ll stick with pERK.\n\nWait, but I should check if any of these terms need to be more specific. For example, MEK is MAP2K1, and ERK is MAPK3, but using the full names might not be necessary if the abbreviations are standard. The guidelines suggest using the name column\'s phrasing for consistency.\n\nSo, I think each id maps directly to their names: pMEK, ERK, pERK. There\'s no need for further modification because they are already single words and widely recognized in biological contexts.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object will have keys as the ids and values as their respective names.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any receptors or ligands listed. The terms are pMEK and ERK. So maybe I don\'t need to worry about that part here. \n\nNext, the guidelines say that in some cases, a two-step process might be needed. First, map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. The replacement table here has `id` as pMEK and ERK, and their `name` is the same as `id`. The references are MAP2K1 and MAPK3 for pMEK and ERK respectively.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines. The main points are:\n\n1. Each term must be a single word.\n2. Replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the replacement table.\n3. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"".\n4. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map \'id\' to \'name\', then refine using references.\n5. Include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore, e.g., ""IL6_R_active"".\n6. If the term is already clear, don\'t change it.\n7. Prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency.\n8. Output as a JSON object with \'id\' as key and term as value.\n9. No explanations, just JSON.\n\nNow, looking at the input equation: pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK\n\nThe replacement table has four entries, two reactants and two products. Let\'s go through each id.\n\n1. Reactant pMEK: The name is pMEK, and the reference is MAP2K1. Since pMEK is a known abbreviation for phosphorylated MEK, and it\'s already clear, I don\'t need to change it. So, the term remains ""pMEK"".\n\n2. Reactant ERK: The name is ERK, reference is MAPK3. ERK is a common abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Since it\'s already a standard term, I leave it as ""ERK"".\n\n3. Product pMEK: Same as reactant, so it\'s ""pMEK"".\n\n4. Product pERK: The name is pERK, reference is MAPK1. pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK. ERK is typically referred to as ERK1 or ERK2, but pERK is commonly used. Since the user prefers single words and pERK is clear, I keep it as ""pERK"".\n\nI don\'t see any need for receptor or ligand terms here because all the terms are kinases. There\'s no mention of states like active or bound in the references, so I don\'t add those. Also, since all terms are straightforward abbreviations, no further changes are needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id directly to their respective terms without any alterations.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK. The replacement table has four entries. Let me list them out:\n\n1. Reactants: pMEK, id is pMEK, name is pMEK, references include urn:miriam:bao:0002007 and MAP2K1.\n2. Reactants: ERK, id is ERK, name is ERK, references include MAPK3.\n3. Products: pMEK, same as reactants.\n4. Products: pERK, id is pERK, name is pERK, references include urn:miriam:bao:0002007 and MAPK1.\n\nSo, I need to map each id (pMEK, ERK, pERK) to a biologically accurate term. \n\nStarting with pMEK: The name is pMEK, which stands for phosphorylated MEK. MEK is a kinase, specifically MAP2K1 as per the reference. But the name is already pMEK, which is a common abbreviation. Since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it significantly. So pMEK should stay pMEK.\n\nERK: The name is ERK, which is another kinase, MAPK3. ERK is a well-known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. Again, the name is ERK, and it\'s commonly used, so it\'s better to keep it as ERK for clarity.\n\npERK: The name is pERK, which stands for phosphorylated ERK. The reference points to MAPK1, which is another ERK isoform, but the name is pERK. Since it\'s a direct abbreviation, I\'ll stick with pERK.\n\nWait, but I should check if any of these terms need to be more specific. For example, MEK is MAP2K1, and ERK is MAPK3, but using the full names might not be necessary if the abbreviations are standard. The guidelines suggest using the name column\'s phrasing for consistency.\n\nSo, I think each id maps directly to their names: pMEK, ERK, pERK. There\'s no need for further modification because they are already single words and widely recognized in biological contexts.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object will have keys as the ids and values as their respective names.']","['pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK', 'pMEK + ERK => pMEK + pERK']","['Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat13*pMEK*ERK/(ERK+Km13)/Cell']","[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True]",96.0,11.419409993571547,2.1138697550607177,21.0,1.168338656425476,2.9370320441963145,6.0,0.18238559365272522,2.797606914125181,14.75,2.7522475783757367,5.0,18

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll use the underscore notation: ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its respective term. So, fEGFR is ""EGFR"", EGF is ""EGF"", and bEGFR is ""EGFR_EGF_bound"". I think this meets all the user\'s requirements and follows the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the interleukin-6 receptor, I should write it as ""IL6_R"". Similarly, if it\'s ""L"", maybe ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the id to the name using the replacement table, and then refine it using references for biological accuracy. So I need to check both the name and reference columns.\n\nLooking at the input equation: DiL00UU equals Di00UU plus L, and it\'s part of the modifiers. The replacement table has three entries. Let\'s look at each id:\n\n1. DiL00UU: It\'s in the role of reactants and modifiers. The name is DiL00UU, and there\'s no reference provided. Since there\'s no additional info, maybe it\'s an abbreviation or a specific term that\'s already interpretable as-is. So perhaps it stays as ""DiL00UU"".\n\n2. Di00UU: This is a product, and the name is the same. The reference is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So according to the guidelines, since the reference is more specific, but the name is ""Di00UU"", I need to check if it\'s a standard abbreviation. If Di00UU is an abbreviation for EGFR, then maybe the term should be ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say if the name is already interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. Wait, but in the example given, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" because it\'s a receptor. Here, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So perhaps Di00UU should be mapped to ""EGFR"".\n\n3. L: This is another product, name is ""L"", reference is EGF. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, which is a ligand. So according to the guidelines, if it\'s a ligand, we can use the name from the reference, which is EGF. So ""L"" should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, the example shows ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps the format is [ligand_name]_[L]. In this case, since the reference is EGF, it should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines says if the name is already okay, don\'t change it. So for Di00UU, the name is Di00UU, but the reference is EGFR. Since Di00UU isn\'t a standard term, maybe we should map it to EGFR. But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column. Hmm, that\'s a bit conflicting. Maybe in this case, since the reference is a known receptor, it\'s better to use ""EGFR"" for clarity.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the user\'s note: ""If the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, it is not recommended to make significant changes."" So Di00UU is an id, and its name is Di00UU, which is an abbreviation. Since it\'s a product and the reference is EGFR, perhaps we should map it to ""EGFR"" because it\'s more biologically meaningful. Similarly, ""L"" should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines had ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" because it\'s a receptor. So perhaps ""Di00UU"" should be ""EGFR"" since it\'s a receptor, and ""L"" should be ""EGF_L"" as the ligand. So the JSON should reflect that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object mapping each id in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it with references. Also, include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" if needed, connected with an underscore. If the term is already clear, don\'t change it much. Prioritize the name column for consistency.\n\nNow, the input equation is c3 + c529 => c550. The replacement table has three entries: c3, c529, and c550. Let\'s break them down.\n\nStarting with c3: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references are ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The term should be a single word. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, maybe combine them as EGF_EGFR. But wait, the name includes ATP, but the guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible. So, I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c529: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The ""h"" might indicate a conformational state, like ""active"" or ""bound"". So, perhaps this is EGF bound to the active form of EGFR. So, the term could be EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNow, c550: The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". This looks like a dimer or complex of two EGF-EGFR-ATP units, one in the regular state and one in the active state. So, maybe it\'s the active dimer. Combining them, it would be EGF_EGFR_dimer_active.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'ll use underscores to connect them. Also, I\'ll check if any of the terms can be simplified. For c3 and c529, they both involve EGF and EGFR, just different states. c550 is a complex of both, so the dimer with active state makes sense.\n\nLet me review the guidelines again. Do I need to include the ATP? The guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible, so maybe omitting ATP is okay since it\'s part of the reaction but not the primary biological term. Also, the references for c3 include EGF, ATP, and EGFR, so I think combining EGF and EGFR is appropriate.\n\nI think that\'s it. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each id maps correctly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c526, c499, and c554. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c526 is a reactant. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh"". I need to parse this. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is a receptor. The ""h"" might stand for ""homodimer"" or something similar, and ""Inh"" could be an inhibitor. But since the guidelines say to use context, maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s state. So combining them, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh"". But wait, the guidelines mention using underscores for receptors and ligands. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_h"" with the state ""Inh"". So the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h_Inh"".\n\nNext, c499 is another reactant with the name ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and references EGF and EGFR. Since the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"", and the reference confirms it\'s EGF and EGFR (which is ErbB1), I can map it similarly. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"".\n\nNow, c554 is a product, and the name is a bit more complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:Inh::EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh)"". The double colon might indicate a complex or dimer. So combining the two, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh"" combined with itself. But since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s the active form. So the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"". Alternatively, since both are Inh, perhaps it\'s a dimer in the active state. So combining them, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to make it a single word. So I should use underscores. So c554 would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"", but perhaps the state is already part of the name, so maybe just ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term as I derived.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c5 + c105 => c116. So, we have three ids here: c5, c105, and c116. Each of these has an entry in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c5. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P. The reference column is empty, so I don\'t have any additional info. EGF is epidermal growth factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor. The _P might stand for phosphorylated. So, I think the term should combine EGF and ErbB1 with the state. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\nNext is c105. The name is ATP with a concentration value, 1.2e9. The reference is empty. ATP is adenosine triphosphate, a common molecule, so maybe just ""ATP"" is sufficient. The number is just a concentration, not part of the term.\n\nFinally, c116. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive, and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1, so it\'s consistent. The term includes EGF, ErbB1, ATP, and it\'s in the full active state. So, I need to combine these into a single term. Since it\'s active, I can add ""_active"" at the end. So, ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c5 to ""EGF_ErbB1_P"", c105 to ""ATP"", and c116 to ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c150 + c105 => c128. Each of these ids (c150, c105, c128) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c150, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB4. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB4_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the name is simply ATP. The references are empty. Since ATP is a well-known molecule, I don\'t need to change it. So, the term is just ATP.\n\nLastly, c128 has the name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP and references EGF; EGFR. The role is product. Here, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest adding states like ""active"" as part of the term. So, combining these, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, prioritize the name column for consistency. So, the final JSON should have c150 mapped to ErbB1_ErbB4_P, c105 to ATP, and c128 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor.

This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is species_25 + species_1 => species_0. So, we\'re dealing with three species here: 25, 1, and 0.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- species_25 is mapped to EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is also EGF. Since EGF is already a well-known ligand, I don\'t need to change it. So, species_25 should just be EGF.\n\n- species_1 is mapped to free_EGFR, but the reference is EGFR. The name is \'free_EGFR\', which suggests it\'s the free form of the receptor. According to the guidelines, if the term is a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. But since \'free_EGFR\' is more specific, indicating it\'s the unbound form, I should use that. So, species_1 becomes free_EGFR.\n\n- species_0 is mapped to pEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The name is \'pEGFR\', which stands for phosphorylated EGFR. This is a specific state of the receptor, so I should keep it as pEGFR.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word and use underscores where necessary. For example, \'free_EGFR\' is a single term connected by an underscore. Similarly, \'pEGFR\' is already a single term.\n\nI don\'t see any ambiguity here, so no further refinements are needed. Each id maps directly to its name without requiring additional context from the references beyond what\'s provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have species_25 as ""EGF"", species_1 as ""free_EGFR"", and species_0 as ""pEGFR"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The replacement table has three entries: Rp_pShc, Rp, and pShc. The references for Rp are EGF and EGFR, while pShc doesn\'t have any references.\n\nStarting with Rp_pShc, since it\'s a reactant and doesn\'t have a name or reference, I\'ll need to break it down. The product side has Rp and pShc. From the references, Rp is linked to EGF and EGFR. I know that EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is its receptor. So, Rp might stand for EGF receptor. Similarly, pShc is probably Shc, a signaling protein, perhaps in a phosphorylated state.\n\nSo, combining Rp and pShc, I think Rp_pShc should be EGF receptor bound to Shc. Since it\'s a complex, I\'ll use an underscore to combine them: ""EGFR_bound_Shc"".\n\nNext, looking at Rp, it\'s a product with references EGF and EGFR. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, I should represent this as ""EGF_L"" because it\'s the ligand form. That\'s a single word, so that\'s good.\n\nFor pShc, there\'s no reference, but it\'s a product. It\'s likely the phosphorylated form of Shc. So I\'ll represent it as ""Shc_active"" to indicate its active state.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each term is a single word, using underscores where necessary and including states if applicable. I also need to avoid making unnecessary changes if the term is already clear.\n\nSo, the final JSON would have ""Rp_pShc"" mapped to ""EGFR_bound_Shc"", ""Rp"" to ""EGF_L"", and ""pShc"" to ""Shc_active"".

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

For Rp, the name is empty, but the references mention EGF and EGFR. Since Rp is a reactant, it\'s likely referring to a ligand, which is EGF, and a receptor, which is EGFR. According to the guidelines, if a receptor and ligand can be identified, I should combine them with an underscore. So, Rp should be ""EGFR_EGF"".\n\nFor Ri, the name is also empty, and there are no references provided. Since it\'s a product, it might be the active state of the receptor after binding.

The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1, the name is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should make it a single word. EGF is an acronym for Epidermal Growth Factor, but since it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So x1 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It\'s a receptor, so I need to add ""_R"" to make it clear. So x2 becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, x3 is EGF-EGFR, which is a complex of the ligand and receptor. The name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references confirm both EGF and EGFR.

EGF and EGFR are pretty standard, so no ambiguity here.

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the input includes an equation: L_EGFR_dimer becomes L_dpEGFR. There\'s a replacement table with two entries. Both have the same references: EGF and EGFR, but different roles—reactants and products.\n\nThe guidelines say each term should be a single word. So, I can\'t have spaces. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"".\n\nLooking at the replacement table, the \'id\'s are L_EGFR_dimer and L_dpEGFR. The \'name\' column is empty, so I need to rely on the \'references\' which are EGF and EGFR.\n\nI remember that EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, and EGF is its ligand. So, in the context of reactions, L might stand for ligand. Therefore, L_EGFR_dimer could be EGF bound to EGFR, forming a dimer. Similarly, L_dpEGFR might be a processed form, maybe the soluble EGFR.\n\nWait, the references are the same for both, but the roles are reactants and products. So, the reactant is the dimer (EGFR bound to EGF), and the product is the processed EGFR, perhaps without the EGF.\n\nSo, for the reactant, it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR, forming a dimer. That would be EGF as the ligand, so the term should be EGF_EGFR. Since it\'s a dimer, maybe we can add \'bound\' or \'dimer\' as a state. But the guideline says to use states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term with an underscore. So, maybe EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_dimer.\n\nBut the \'name\' column is empty, so I need to rely on the \'references\'. Since both references are EGF and EGFR, I think the term should combine them. So, for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s the ligand (EGF) bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"". But since it\'s a dimer, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nSimilarly, for L_dpEGFR, it\'s the processed form, so maybe just ""EGFR_s"" where \'s\' stands for soluble.

So, I think the correct terms are EGF (ligand) and EGFR (receptor). But how to represent them?\n\nThe equation shows that L_EGFR_dimer is converted to L_dpEGFR. So, the reactant is the dimer (probably EGF bound to EGFR), and the product is the processed EGFR without the ligand.\n\nSo, for L_EGFR_dimer, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"". The product, L_dpEGFR, might be ""EGFR_s"" or ""EGFR_soluble"".\n\nBut the guidelines say to use single words, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is better than adding ""dimer"". Or perhaps ""EGFR_dimer"".\n\nWait, but the \'id\' is L_EGFR_dimer. Since L is ligand, it\'s EGF, so L_EGFR_dimer would be EGF bound to EGFR in a dimer. So, combining ligand and receptor, it\'s EGF_EGFR. Since it\'s a dimer, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nFor L_dpEGFR, dp usually stands for dimerization or processing.

Hmm. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, since both have the same references, maybe the terms are simply ""EGF"" and ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore if they can be identified. So, L is ligand (EGF), EGFR is receptor. So, for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s EGF bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nAnd L_dpEGFR is the processed EGFR, so maybe ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut the \'id\'s are L_EGFR_dimer and L_dpEGFR, so perhaps the terms are ""EGF_EGFR"" and ""EGFR"".\n\nWait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. The replacement table has \'id\'s with L and EGFR. The references are EGF and EGFR. So, L_EGFR_dimer is EGF bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"". L_dpEGFR is the soluble EGFR, so ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut the user\'s output example in the problem statement was:\n\n{\n  ""L_EGFR_dimer"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""L_dpEGFR"": ""EGFR""\n}\n\nWait, no, in the problem statement, the output was just a comment, but the actual answer was the JSON. So, perhaps the correct terms are ""EGF_EGFR"" for L_EGFR_dimer and ""EGFR"" for L_dpEGFR.\n\nI think that\'s the right approach because the ligand is EGF, receptor is EGFR, so combining them as ""EGF_EGFR"" makes sense.

That means if there\'s a receptor and ligand involved, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But sometimes, I might need to do a two-step process: first map the `id` to the `name` using the table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy.\n\nI should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term, separated by an underscore. If the term is already simple or clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. If the `name` and `references` have synonyms, I should prioritize the `name` for consistency.\n\nLooking at their input, the equation is RcL00UU => Rc00UU + L; RcL00UU. The replacement table has four entries:\n\n1. Reactants: RcL00UU, name is RcL00UU, no references.\n2. Products: Rc00UU, name is Rc00UU, reference is EGFR.\n3. Products: L, name is L, reference is EGF.\n4. Modifiers: RcL00UU, same as the first entry.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically meaningful term. Starting with RcL00UU. The `name` is the same as the `id`, and there\'s no reference. So maybe it\'s a complex or a receptor-ligand pair. Since the products are Rc00UU (EGFR) and L (EGF), I can infer that RcL00UU is the bound state of EGFR and EGF. So the term should be EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nNext, Rc00UU has the name Rc00UU and reference EGFR. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the receptor alone, so EGFR.\n\nLastly, L is mapped to EGF, so the term is EGF.\n\nI think that covers all the `id`s in the replacement table. Now, putting it all together into a JSON object.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x10 => x11. The replacement table has two rows. For x10, the name is EGF-EGFRi, and references are EGFR and EGF. For x11, the name is EGF-EGFRi^2, with the same references.\n\nI need to map each id (x10 and x11) to a biologically interpretable term. Starting with x10: the name is EGF-EGFRi. I know that EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, and EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor. The \'i\' might stand for \'inhibitor\', so EGF-EGFRi could mean EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor. But according to the guidelines, if I can identify the receptor and ligand specifically, I should combine them with an underscore. Since EGFR is the receptor for EGF, maybe x10 is the ligand (EGF) bound to the receptor (EGFR). But the name has \'i\' which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe it\'s the inhibited form.\n\nWait, the references are EGFR and EGF. So perhaps x10 is EGF bound to EGFR, forming a complex. So the term would be EGF_EGFR. But the name is EGF-EGFRi, so maybe it\'s the inhibited complex. However, the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay. But the name is already a bit specific, so maybe I should just combine EGF and EGFR as EGF_EGFR.\n\nFor x11, the name is EGF-EGFRi^2, which might indicate a dimer or a complex with two units. So perhaps it\'s the active or bound state. Maybe EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active. But the guidelines suggest including states with an underscore, so maybe EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, considering the equation x10 => x11, it\'s likely a reaction where EGF binds to EGFR, forming a complex, and then maybe dimerizes or becomes active. So x10 might be the initial binding (EGF_EGFR), and x11 is the active form (EGF_EGFR_active).\n\nWait, but the references for both are the same, so I should prioritize the name column. For x10, the name is EGF-EGFRi, which might be the inhibited form. But without more context, it\'s safer to assume it\'s the receptor-ligand complex. So I\'ll map x10 to EGF_EGFR and x11 to EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nBut wait, the name for x11 is EGF-EGFRi^2, which might imply a dimer. So perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR_dimer or EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. So for x10, the name is EGF-EGFRi, which I can interpret as EGF bound to EGFR inhibitor. But perhaps it\'s more accurate to see it as EGF bound to EGFR, making it EGF_EGFR. Similarly, x11 is EGF-EGFRi^2, which could be the dimer form, so EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nI think the key is to use the name as the primary source, but also consider the references. Since both have EGFR and EGF as references, the main components are EGF and EGFR. So I\'ll combine them into a single term with an underscore.\n\nSo, mapping x10 to EGF_EGFR and x11 to EGF_EGFR_active, because x11 is the product, implying a change from x10. Alternatively, x11 could be the bound state, so EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change much. Since the names are specific, I should use them as is but adjust for biological accuracy. So for x10, EGF-EGFRi becomes EGF_EGFR. For x11, EGF-EGFRi^2 becomes EGF_EGFR_bound or active.\n\nI think the best approach is to make x10 EGF_EGFR and x11 EGF_EGFR_bound, indicating the transition from binding to a bound state.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c148 + c105 => c122. There are three ids here: c148, c105, and c122. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c148. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB2 is HER2. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be something like ""EGFR:HER2_phosphorylated"". I\'ll use underscores to combine them as per the guidelines.\n\nNext, c105. The name is ""ATP  1.2e9"". Hmm, ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate, a common molecule. The number might be a concentration, but since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"".\n\nThen, c122. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2:ATP"" and references include EGF and EGFR. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the term can be simplified. So, it\'s ""EGF:EGFR:HER2:ATP"".\n\nWait, I should check if any of these can be further refined. For c148, combining the receptors with their state makes sense. c105 is straightforward. For c122, the references mention EGF and EGFR, so using EGFR instead of ErbB1 is better for clarity.\n\nSo, the JSON should have each id mapped to their respective terms as I\'ve determined.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I also need to consider if more context is needed, like states such as ""bound"" or ""active"". \n\nThe user mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name` using the table, then refine it using references. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency. If the term is already an abbreviation and clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is Rc00UU + L => RcL00UU; Rc00UU, L. The replacement table has rows with role, id, name, and references. For reactants, Rc00UU maps to Rc00UU with a reference to EGFR. L maps to L with a reference to EGF. The products row for RcL00UU doesn\'t have a reference, and modifiers have the same mappings as reactants.\n\nSo, I need to map each id: Rc00UU, L, RcL00UU. From the replacement table, Rc00UU is associated with EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I can represent it as EGFR_R. L is associated with EGF, a ligand, so that would be EGF_L. For RcL00UU, which is a product, it\'s the complex of Rc00UU and L, so combining EGFR and EGF, it should be EGFR_EGF. Since it\'s the bound state, I\'ll add ""_bound"" to make it EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. I think I\'ve covered all the guidelines and provided the correct JSON structure as required.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given is an equation: Rp_pShc => Rp + pShc. The replacement table has three entries: Rp_pShc, Rp, and pShc. The references for Rp are EGF and EGFR, while pShc doesn\'t have any references.\n\nStarting with Rp_pShc, since it\'s a reactant and doesn\'t have a name or reference, I\'ll need to break it down. The product side has Rp and pShc. From the references, Rp is linked to EGF and EGFR. I know that EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is its receptor. So, Rp might stand for EGF receptor. Similarly, pShc probably stands for phosphorylated Shc.\n\nSo, Rp_pShc could be the complex formed when EGF binds to its receptor. Since the product is Rp (EGFR) and pShc, the reactant is likely the active form of EGFR after binding. I should represent this as a single term, perhaps combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore and adding the state.\n\nGiven that, I\'ll map Rp_pShc to ""EGF_EGFR_active"". This combines the ligand EGF with the receptor EGFR and adds the \'active\' state to indicate it\'s bound and active.\n\nFor Rp, the references are EGF and EGFR. Since Rp is the receptor, I should map it to the receptor term, which is EGFR. So, Rp becomes ""EGFR"".\n\npShc, on the other hand, is a product. Since it\'s phosphorylated Shc, it\'s already a specific term, so it stays as ""pShc"".\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word. ""EGF_EGFR_active"" is one word with underscores, which fits the requirement. Rp_pShc is being replaced because it\'s ambiguous, while Rp and pShc are specific enough as they are.\n\nSo, the JSON object should have keys for each id and their corresponding terms. I\'ll structure it as {""Rp_pShc"": ""EGF_EGFR_active"", ""Rp"": ""EGFR"", ""pShc"": ""pShc""}.\n\nI think this meets all the guidelines: single words, specific terms where necessary, using references, and keeping it concise without extra explanations.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The replacement table has three rows. The first two are reactants: Rp and RasGAP. The product is Rp_RasGAP. \n\nLooking at the replacement table details, for Rp, the name is empty, but the references are EGF and EGFR. So, Rp probably stands for something related to EGF or EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, maybe Rp is the receptor part, so I should map it to EGFR. \n\nRasGAP\'s name is also empty, and there are no references. But I know RasGAP stands for Ras-GAP, which is a protein involved in signaling. So I\'ll just use RasGAP as it is since it\'s a well-known term.\n\nThe product is Rp_RasGAP.

The replacement table has four entries, but two of them are in the \'reactants\' and \'modifiers\' roles. The \'id\'s are Rp_RasGAP, Rp, RasGAP, and mIRSp_SHP2.\n\nStarting with Rp_RasGAP: The role is reactants, and both name and references are empty. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s a complex or a protein. I need to see if Rp or RasGAP have references elsewhere. Looking at the products, Rp is associated with EGF and EGFR, so Rp might be the receptor part. RasGAP is a known protein, so perhaps it\'s a GAP for Ras.

For iSrc, the role is reactants, id is iSrc, name is empty, references are empty. Since there\'s no name or reference, I need to think about what iSrc could stand for. It might be a typo or shorthand. Given the context, maybe \'i\' stands for inactive, so inactive Src. So, I\'ll map iSrc to \'Inactive_Src\'.\n\n2. aSrc is a product, so it\'s the active form of Src. The name and references are empty, but following the same logic, aSrc would be \'Active_Src\'.\n\n3. Rp has the role modifiers, id Rp, name empty, references are EGF and EGFR. EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So Rp should be \'EGFR\'.\n\n4. IRp is another modifier, id IRp, name empty, references are also EGF and EGFR.

That makes sense because the reaction is moving from a bound state to an active state.\n\nSo, I should follow the same logic. For each id, I\'ll look at the name and references. Since the name for \'x4\' is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", the \'^2\' probably denotes a bound state. So, the term becomes ""EGF-EGFR_bound"". For \'x5\', the name is ""EGF-EGFR*^2"", which might indicate an active state, so ""EGF-EGFR_active"".\n\nI should also ensure that each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, combining them makes sense. The states \'bound\' and \'active\' are added as per the example.\n\nI think that\'s it.

Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c3 + c502 => c504. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c3, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, maybe I should combine them into a single term. The format is ligand_receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. But wait, the guidelines mention if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So I think it\'s EGF as ligand and ErbB1 as receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I\'m not sure if I should include it. The guidelines say to use context, so maybe just EGF_ErbB1.\n\n- For c502, the name is ""ErbB2:Inh"" and no references. Since it\'s a receptor and inhibitor, maybe ErbB2 is a receptor, so maybe it\'s just ErbB2. Or since it\'s an inhibitor, perhaps Inh is the ligand? But I\'m not sure. The guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms. Since ""Inh"" is unclear, maybe I should look at the products. The product c504 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh. So perhaps c502 is just ErbB2, so the term is ErbB2.\n\n- For c504, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh"" and references EGF, EGFR. This seems to combine all three, so the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2, maybe with Inh as a state? But the guidelines say to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore. Since Inh could be a state, maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh. But I\'m not sure if ""Inh"" is a state or a ligand. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a complex, so the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, looking at the product, it\'s (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh, which might mean that the complex is inhibited. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused. Let me think again.\n\nc3 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So combining them as EGF_ErbB1. The ATP is part of the reaction, but the term is about the components, so maybe EGF_ErbB1.\n\nc502 is ErbB2:Inh. Since it\'s a receptor and an inhibitor, maybe it\'s just ErbB2, or maybe it\'s the inhibited state. The product combines all three, so perhaps c502 is just ErbB2.\n\nc504 is the product, combining EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and Inh. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 with an inh state. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.\n\nBut I\'m not sure about including Inh as a state. The guidelines say to include states like bound or active, but Inh might not be a standard state. Alternatively, it\'s part of the complex, so perhaps just EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, the product is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh. So it\'s a complex that is inhibited.

Alternatively, including the Inh as a state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps c504 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2, as the product of the reaction, and the Inh is part of the complex\'s state.\n\nHmm, I think I\'ll go with that. So the JSON would map c3 to EGF_ErbB1, c502 to ErbB2, and c504 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the replacement table. There are three entries: c3, c526, and c527. Each has a role, id, name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term based on the name and references, following the guidelines.\n\nStarting with c3. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"". I remember from the guidelines that if a term is a simple abbreviation or interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it much. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 is a receptor. So, according to the example, we connect them with an underscore. So EGF as the ligand would be ""EGF_L"" and ErbB1 as the receptor would be ""ErbB1_R"". Since the name includes both, I can combine them as ""EGF_ErbB1_R"". The ATP is part of the name, but since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s just part of the process, so I\'ll focus on the receptor and ligand part.\n\nNext, c526. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh"". The ""h"" might stand for ""homodimer"" or ""heterodimer,"" and ""Inh"" could mean inhibited or inactivated. So this is the inhibited form of the EGF-ErbB1 complex. Using the guidelines, I should include the state, so I\'ll add ""_inhibited"" at the end. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_R_inhibited"".\n\nThen, c527. The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh)"". This looks like a complex formed by the two reactants. So combining the two, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_R_bound_EGF_ErbB1_R_inhibited"". This shows the binding between the active and inhibited forms.\n\nI should also check the references for each id to ensure accuracy. For c3, the references are EGF, ATP, and EGFR. That confirms that EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, so ""EGF_ErbB1_R"" makes sense. For c526, since there are no references, I have to rely on the name, so I\'m a bit uncertain but proceed with the name\'s info. For c527, again, no references, so I use the name\'s structure to form the term.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, if a state like ""bound"" or ""active"" is present, I include it. Since c527 is a product, it\'s the bound state, so I add ""_bound"" between the two complexes.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id correctly with the terms I\'ve derived.

So, I need to convert these into single words, possibly using underscores.\n\nFor c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The guideline suggests that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor. So, combining them gives ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSimilarly, for c499, the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh. Inh might stand for inhibited or inhibitor. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_inh"".\n\nFor c500, the name is a combination of ATP and Inh. Since c500 is the product, it\'s a complex of the two. So, combining the terms from c3 and c499, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word with underscores as needed. Also, I should check if the references suggest any other terms, but in this case, EGF and EGFR are consistent across all references, so I\'ll stick with those.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- c3: EGF_EGFR\n- c499: EGF_EGFR_inh\n- c500: EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh\n\nThat should cover all the ids with biologically interpretable terms as single words.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c10 + c155 => c159. So, c10 and c155 are reactants, and c159 is the product.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each id has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c10: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and the references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. The guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, use an underscore. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, EGF_L and EGFR_R. But wait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. Hmm, maybe it\'s EGF bound to EGFR with ATP? So perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest including states like ""active"" or ""bound"" as part of the term with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L_bound_to_EGFR_R or something like that. But the example given was ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps the format is ligand_L or receptor_R.\n\nWait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So it\'s ligand followed by _L or receptor followed by _R. So for c10, which is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R. But since it\'s all together, perhaps the term should reflect that. But the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. Maybe EGF_ErbB1_ATP? But that\'s three parts. Alternatively, since EGF binds to EGFR, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R, but the name is a combination. Hmm, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR since that\'s a common term.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which is the ligand, receptor, and ATP. Maybe it\'s the active form of the receptor. So perhaps EGF_EGFR_active. But the guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nBut the references include EGFR, so maybe the term should be EGFR. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so perhaps it\'s the complex. But I\'m supposed to make a single word. So maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c155: The name is ErbB2, and references are empty. Since it\'s a receptor, perhaps it\'s ErbB2_R. But wait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"", so the receptor is denoted with _R. So maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nBut the name is just ErbB2, so perhaps it\'s sufficient as ErbB2. Alternatively, if it\'s a receptor, maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nNow, c159: The name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), references include EGF and EGFR. So this is the product, which is a trimer of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe c10 can be EGF_EGFR, c155 is ErbB2, and c159 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nBut let me check the guidelines again. For c10, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 (EGFR) with ATP. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active. But the example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe for c10, it\'s EGF_L and EGFR_R, but since it\'s a combination, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR.\n\nWait, but the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. So perhaps EGF_EGFR is acceptable.\n\nFor c155, since the name is ErbB2 and there\'s no reference, maybe it\'s ErbB2_R as it\'s a receptor.\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so it\'s a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nBut the references for c159 include EGF and EGFR, so perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nHmm, I think I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR for c10, ErbB2_R for c155, and EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 for c159.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the product was ""IL6_R_active"". So maybe c159 should have a state like ""active"" or ""bound"". But the name doesn\'t specify that, so perhaps it\'s just the complex.\n\nAlternatively, since it\'s the product, it\'s the active form, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active.\n\nBut the guidelines say to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term with an underscore. So if the product is the active form, maybe include that.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the name indicates that. The name is just the components, so maybe it\'s just the complex without a state.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nc10: EGF_EGFR\nc155: ErbB2_R\nc159: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2\n\nWait, but the references for c10 include EGFR, so maybe it\'s better to use EGFR instead of ErbB1. So c10 would be EGF_EGFR.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c155"": ""ErbB2_R"",\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""\n}\n\nBut wait, in the example, the product was ""IL6_R_active"". So maybe c159 should have a state. But since the name doesn\'t specify, I\'m not sure. Maybe it\'s just the complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps c159 is the active form, so it could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active.\n\nBut without specific info, I think it\'s safer to just use the components.\n\nSo, final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c155"": ""ErbB2_R"",\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""\n}', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c11, c105, and c126. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and some references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c11 has the name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". The guidelines say that if we can identify a receptor or ligand, we should combine them with an underscore. Here, EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, which is also known as EGFR. So, EGF binds to EGFR. Since ATP is part of the complex, but it\'s an enzyme component, maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s activity. So, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references. The name is a bit ambiguous because it\'s just ATP with a number. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as is. So, I\'ll map c105 to ""ATP"" since it\'s already a known term.\n\nFor c126, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1):ATP"" with references ""EGF; EGFR"". Again, EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR). The "":ATP"" might indicate the receptor\'s active state with ATP bound. So, combining them and adding the state, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have c11 as ""EGF_EGFR"", c105 as ""ATP"", and c126 as ""EGF_EGFR_active"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c280 + c11 => c415. So, c280 and c11 are reactants, and c415 is the product.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each id has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c280. The name is RTK_Pase. The references are empty. RTK stands for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, and Pase might be a specific form or state. Since it\'s already a single word, and according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it. So, c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nNext is c11. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP). The references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. So, this is a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. The name is a bit complicated. The guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor. So, I should map this to ""EGF_ErbB1"". The number 2 in the name might indicate dimerization or multiple binding, but the guidelines don\'t mention handling numbers, so I\'ll ignore that for now.\n\nNow, c415 is the product. Its name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. The references are empty. The term is a bit complex. It has EGF:ErbB1 with a _P suffix and RTK_Pase. The _P might indicate phosphorylation or another state. From the guidelines, if there\'s a state like active or bound, it should be included. So, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" is the state here, and it\'s associated with RTK_Pase. But since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form. So, maybe the term is ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_active"". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since RTK_Pase is the same as c280, perhaps the product combines both.\n\nWait, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. So it\'s a complex of EGF_ErbB1 in a phosphorylated state and RTK_Pase. But in the guidelines, for products, I should create a single word if possible. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. So, maybe the term is ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"".\n\nBut looking back, c280 is RTK_Pase, which is a reactant. So, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex. So, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nAlternatively, considering the guidelines, if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine. The name for c415 is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. So, perhaps I should split this into two parts: EGF_ErbB1_P and RTK_Pase. But since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a single term combining both, like ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"".\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe I should consider that the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex, so ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if a term can be identified as receptor or ligand, create a single word with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, the complex would be ""EGF_ErbB1"". Then, the _P might indicate a state, like active or bound. So, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"".\n\nBut the product is formed from the reactants c280 (RTK_Pase) and c11 (EGF_ErbB1). So, maybe the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex, so ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nAlternatively, since the product\'s name includes ""_P"", which might stand for phosphorylated, perhaps it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\nBut the guidelines mention that states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included. So, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" is appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc280 -> RTK_Pase (since it\'s a single word and already interpretable)\n\nc11 -> EGF_ErbB1 (receptor and ligand connected with underscore)\n\nc415 -> EGF_ErbB1_active (since it\'s the product, likely the active state of the complex)\n\nWait, but looking at the product name, it\'s 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. The 2 might indicate dimerization, but I\'m not sure how to handle that. The guidelines don\'t mention handling numbers, so perhaps I can ignore that and focus on the main components.\n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c280"": ""RTK_Pase"",\n  ""c11"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c415"": ""EGF_ErbB1_active""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident about c415. Maybe it\'s better to use ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" instead of ""active"" if _P stands for phosphorylation. Alternatively, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" if _P indicates binding.\n\nWait, the name for c415 is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. The _P might indicate that the complex is in a particular state, perhaps active or bound. Since RTK_Pase is involved, maybe it\'s the active form after binding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex, so ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nI think that\'s the best approach.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` refers to a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and add them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. For each `id`, I should first map it to its `name` and then use the references to refine it if necessary. If the `name` is already clear, I might not need to change it. But if the `name` is an abbreviation or ambiguous, I should use the references to find a better term.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is c140 + c499 => c493.\n\nThe replacement table has:\n- c140: ErbB3\n- c499: EGF:ErbB1:Inh with references EGF; EGFR\n- c493: EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3 with references EGF; EGFR\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s go one by one.\n\nStarting with c140: The name is ErbB3, and the references don\'t provide additional info. Since ErbB3 is a known receptor tyrosine kinase, I can use it as is. So c140 maps to ""ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c499: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF; EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term ""Inh"" might refer to an inhibitor or maybe indicates inhibition. But in this context, it\'s part of the name. So I need to interpret this correctly. The name suggests a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and Inh. But considering the references, EGFR is the same as ErbB1. So perhaps it\'s EGF bound to EGFR (ErbB1) and maybe an inhibitor. But since the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, I should make it a single term. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, combine with an underscore. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, I should connect them. But the ""Inh"" part complicates it. Looking at the references, they don\'t provide more info, so I have to go with the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"".\n\nThen, c493: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, and references are EGF; EGFR. Similar to c499 but includes ErB3. So it\'s EGF, ErbB1, Inh, and ErB3. ErbB3 is another receptor. So perhaps this is a complex involving EGF, EGFR (ErbB1), an inhibitor, and ErbB3. Combining these into a single term, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nWait, but the references for c493 are the same as c499, just EGF and EGFR. So maybe the name is EGF bound to ErbB1, with an inhibitor, and also involving ErbB3. So perhaps it\'s a trimeric complex or something similar. But since the name is given as EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, I should follow that. So combining all with underscores, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nBut I should check if any of these can be simplified. For c499, maybe the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, which could be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". Similarly, c493 is ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that ""Inh"" might stand for inhibitor, perhaps it\'s an EGF-ErbB1 complex with an inhibitor, but without more context, I have to go with the name provided.\n\nSo, compiling this into JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c140"": ""ErbB3"",\n  ""c499"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"",\n  ""c493"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the provided data.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c160 => c86. So, I need to map c160 and c86 based on the replacement table provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, the first row has role \'reactants\', id \'c160\', name \'(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)\', and references \'EGF; EGFR\'. The second row is \'products\', id \'c86\', name \'R_degraded\', and no references.\n\nStarting with c160: The name is a complex of EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB3. The references list EGF and EGFR. So, EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. Since the name includes the ligand and receptors, I need to find a single word that represents this complex. Since the name is already quite specific, I can take it as is but ensure it\'s a single term. So, \'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3\' makes sense. It\'s specific and combines ligand and receptors.\n\nNext, c86: The name is \'R_degraded\'. The guidelines suggest that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. But since the name here is \'R_degraded\', it\'s already a compound term. So, I should map c86 to \'R_degraded\' without changes. It clearly indicates the receptor is degraded, which is biologically meaningful.\n\nI also need to ensure that the JSON object uses the \'id\' as the key and the term as the value. So, the structure should be:\n\n{\n  ""c160"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3"",\n  ""c86"": ""R_degraded""\n}\n\nI think this meets all the guidelines. The terms are single words, and I\'ve combined ligand and receptors for c160, while c86 is left as is because it\'s already a clear term. No two-step process was needed here because the names were sufficiently clear in the replacement table.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c161 + c105 => c125. There\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c161, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), and references are EGF and EGFR. I know that EGF stands for Epidermal Growth Factor. ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. EGF typically binds to ErbB1, which is also called EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). So, the complex here is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. But in reality, EGF mainly binds to ErbB1, so maybe the term should reflect that.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9, and there are no references. Since it\'s ATP, a common molecule, it\'s straightforward. I don\'t need to change it unless it\'s an abbreviation, but in this case, ATP is a standard term, so it should stay as is.\n\nFor c125, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP, with references EGF and EGFR. This seems like the product after ATP binds to the EGF-receptor complex. Since ATP is involved, maybe it\'s part of a signaling pathway, like ATP binding to the receptor after EGF.\n\nNow, following the guidelines:\n\n- Each term must be a single word. So, for complexes, I should combine them with underscores. For example, EGF and the receptor would be EGF_ErbB1. But since ErbB1 is the primary receptor, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1.\n\nWait, in the example given, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So, the format is ligand_receptor or something similar. For c161, it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. But ErbB1 is the main receptor for EGF. ErbB4 usually binds other ligands like neuregulins. So, perhaps c161 should be EGF_ErbB1, and ErbB4 might not be part of this complex in this context.\n\nWait, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), so all three are part of the complex. Maybe it\'s a dimer. So, perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified specifically, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4. But since it\'s a complex, maybe the term should reflect that.\n\nWait, the guidelines also mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map the id to name, then refine using references. So, c161 maps to (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), but the references say EGF and EGFR. So, maybe the correct term is EGF_EGFR, since EGFR is ErbB1.\n\nWait, EGFR is the same as ErbB1, so maybe the complex is EGF_EGFR. But the name includes ErbB4 as well. That\'s confusing. I\'m not sure if ErbB4 is part of the complex here or not.\n\nLooking up, EGF primarily binds to ErbB1 (EGFR), and sometimes forms heterodimers with other receptors like ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4. But in this case, the name specifically includes ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, perhaps the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the guidelines suggest that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, if it\'s EGF and the receptor, it\'s EGF_ErbB1. But since there are two receptors, maybe it\'s a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), perhaps it\'s best to keep it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term. Maybe I should simplify it to EGF_EGFR, as that\'s a common way to denote the EGF receptor.\n\nWait, the references for c161 are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps the name should be EGF_EGFR, as that\'s a more standard term. The presence of ErbB4 might be part of the complex but perhaps not the primary focus here.\n\nFor c105, since it\'s ATP, it remains as ATP.\n\nFor c125, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP. So, after the complex binds ATP, maybe the term is EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound or something similar. But the guidelines suggest using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term. So, perhaps EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound.\n\nBut the references for c125 are EGF and EGFR, same as c161. So, maybe the term is EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nWait, the initial complex c161 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), which I\'m now considering as EGF_EGFR. So, c125 would be EGF_EGFR bound to ATP, so EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc161: EGF_EGFR\nc105: ATP\nc125: EGF_EGFR_ATP\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure about including ErbB4. Maybe it\'s better to stick with the name provided, which includes ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, perhaps the terms should reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, since the references for c161 are EGF and EGFR, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR, and c125 would be EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nWait, but the name for c161 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), so it\'s a ternary complex. So, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nSimilarly, for c125, it\'s that complex plus ATP, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term. It might be too long. Maybe the primary receptor is ErbB1, so EGF_EGFR, and c125 is EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps c125 is the same as c161 but with ATP bound, so EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nBut the name includes ATP, so maybe it\'s better to include it.\n\nI think I\'ll go with:\n\nc161: EGF_ErbB1\nc105: ATP\nc125: EGF_ErbB1_ATP\n\nBut considering the guidelines, I should make it a single word with underscores. So, EGF_ErbB1, ATP, EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, since c161\'s references are EGF and EGFR, maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nSo, final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c161"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c125"": ""EGF_EGFR_ATP""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident about including ErbB4. Maybe it\'s better to include all receptors as per the name. So, c161: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4, c125: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut that\'s a longer term, and the guidelines prefer single words, but with underscores. So, it\'s acceptable as it\'s a single term with underscores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1 as the primary, and c125 as EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nI think I\'ll go with the shorter version since EGFR is a common term, and ErbB4 might not be the primary here.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c8 + c105 => c126. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c8, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1)_P"". The references are empty, so I\'ll focus on the name. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor, also known as EGFR. The ""_P"" probably stands for phosphorylation. So, this is likely the phosphorylated form of the EGF:EGFR complex. I\'ll map c8 to ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\n- For c105, the name is ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references. Since it\'s just ATP with a concentration, and the guideline says if it\'s interpretable as-is, leave it. So c105 is ""ATP"".\n\n- For c126, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1):ATP"" and references are EGF and EGFR. The name suggests the complex of EGF:ErbB1 with ATP. So, I\'ll map c126 to ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nI\'ll make sure each term is a single word with underscores where necessary. No need for additional changes since the names are already clear.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c4 + c105 => c116. There\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", include that with an underscore.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- c4 is a reactant with name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n- c105 is a reactant with name ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references.\n- c116 is a product with name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive"" and references EGF, EGFR.\n\nSo for c4, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". I think this refers to a complex of EGF, ErbB1 (which is the EGFR), and ATP. Since it\'s a complex, maybe it\'s the receptor-ligand-ATP trimer? So perhaps it\'s ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"". But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"", but I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"".\n\nFor c105, the name is ""ATP 1.2e9"". Since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple term, leave it as is. So ""ATP"".\n\nc116\'s name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive"". It\'s a product, so it\'s the active form. So maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"".\n\nWait, but in the example, the product in the output was ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"". So I think that\'s correct.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""c4"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c116"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s how it should be mapped based on the guidelines and the given replacement table.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: x1 + x2 => x3. The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a ligand, I can denote it as EGF_L. That makes sense because ligands bind to receptors.\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR is a receptor, so I\'ll name it EGFR_R. That\'s straightforward.\n\nNow, x3 is a bit trickier. The name is EGF-EGFR, and the references are both EGF and EGFR. According to the guidelines, if the term is a combination, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. But since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, combining them as EGF-EGFR might already imply the complex. However, looking at the guidelines, I should consider the state. Since x3 is a product, it\'s likely the bound state of the receptor-ligand complex. So, I should denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nWait, let me think again. The guidelines say if it\'s a combination, use the name from the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, but the references are both EGF and EGFR. So maybe I should prioritize the name but also consider the biological state. Since it\'s a product, it\'s probably the bound form. So combining them with an underscore and adding the state makes sense. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example had ""IL6_R_active"". So the structure is ligand_receptor_state. Hmm, but in the case of x3, the product is the complex. So maybe it\'s better to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound or EGF_EGFR_bound. I think the correct way is to list the receptor first, followed by the ligand, then the state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because in the guidelines, they said to use the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, which is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nWait, no. The guidelines say that if the term can be a single word, just use it. But since EGF-EGFR is a complex, and it\'s the product, it\'s in the bound state. So I should represent it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me check the example they provided. In the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So for a complex, maybe it\'s better to use receptor first, then ligand, then state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut the name is EGF-EGFR, which is the same as EGF bound to EGFR. So perhaps EGF_EGFR_bound is more accurate.\n\nI think I should go with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nWait, but the references for x3 are EGF and EGFR. So the complex is EGF bound to EGFR. So in the JSON, x3 should be EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x1"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""x2"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""x3"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit uncertain about the ordering. Should it be EGF_EGFR or EGFR_EGF? The example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe the receptor comes first. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nHmm, I think the correct approach is to use the order from the name column. Since the name is EGF-EGFR, I\'ll use that as the base and add the state. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, since EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps it\'s more accurate to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound to show the receptor first.\n\nI\'m a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up how such complexes are typically denoted. Usually, it\'s receptor-ligand, so EGFR_EGF_bound might be more standard.\n\nBut the name is EGF-EGFR, so perhaps that\'s how it should be written. I think I\'ll stick with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nWait, another thought: the product is the result of the reaction, so it\'s the bound form of EGF and EGFR. So in biological terms, it\'s the EGF-EGFR complex, which is bound. So maybe just EGF_EGFR_bound is sufficient.\n\nI think I\'m overcomplicating it. The key is to use the name from the replacement table and add the state if applicable. So since x3\'s name is EGF-EGFR, and it\'s a product, it\'s in the bound state. So the term would be EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlright, I\'ll finalize that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The references for both are ""EGF; EGFR"". My task is to convert these into more interpretable terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, x3 is ""EGF-EGFR"". I think this refers to the ligand EGF bound to its receptor EGFR. Similarly, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimerized form, perhaps after binding.\n\nI need to consider the guidelines. Since ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor, I should map them as ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R"". But wait, the replacement table shows ""EGF-EGFR"" as a single term. Maybe it\'s a complex of the ligand and receptor.\n\nHmm, the user\'s example suggests that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the table, then refine it with references. So, for x3, the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references are EGF and EGFR. So, I should represent this as a complex where EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. Maybe combine them into ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. So, ""EGF"" is a ligand, ""EGFR"" is a receptor. So, maybe ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"". But that\'s two words, and the user wants a single word. Wait, the example shows ""IL6_R"" as a single word. So perhaps I can combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"" without the \'L\' and \'R\' because it\'s a complex.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines shows ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becoming ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the term is already a complex, perhaps I should just use the combined name as a single term. So, ""EGF-EGFR"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut looking at the references, both x3 and x4 have EGF and EGFR. So, x3 is the reactant, which is the unbound form, and x4 is the product, which is the bound or dimerized form. So, for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_active"" or ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include states like \'active\' or \'bound\' unless necessary. So, maybe x4 is the dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" or ""EGF_EGFR_2"".\n\nWait, in the replacement table, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, to represent this, I can add ""_dimer"" or just use ""_2"". But the guidelines say to include states with an underscore. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t add any state, just the combined term. So, perhaps for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"" as the reactant, and x4 is ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" as the product.\n\nAlternatively, since x4 is the product of the reaction x3 => x4, it\'s the bound form. So, maybe x4 should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the references for both x3 and x4 are the same, so maybe the only difference is the state. So, I think the correct approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed ""R"" and ""L"" being combined. So, perhaps I should map x3 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"" and x4 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_active"" or something similar. But that would be two words, and the user wants a single word. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to just combine them into a single term without the \'L\' and \'R\' since the complex is a single entity.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", I can use that as the term, replacing the hyphen with an underscore, making it ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSo, for x3, the term is ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, since it\'s the product, it\'s the same complex but in a different state. The replacement table shows it as ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, I can add ""_dimer"" to it, making it ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nAlternatively, since the user\'s example didn\'t add any state unless necessary, maybe I should just leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, but that doesn\'t capture the difference between x3 and x4.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not changed. So, if ""EGF-EGFR"" is a standard term, maybe I can leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for x3 and ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" for x4.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe the better approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" to indicate the active form after binding.\n\nI think I\'ll go with that. So, the JSON object would have x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. The user wants each term to be a single word. If there\'s an ambiguous term, I need to replace it with something more specific using the replacement table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column over \'references\' for consistency. Finally, the output should be a JSON object without any extra comments.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x8 => x87. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n1. reactants: x8 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" with references EGFR and EGF.\n2. products: x87 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" with no references.\n\nI need to process each id (x8 and x87) and map them to the correct terms.\n\nStarting with x8:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"". The references are EGFR and EGF. I know that EGFR is the receptor and EGF is the ligand. The \'i\' likely stands for \'inhibitor\', and the \'*^2\' might be a subscript indicating a dimer or something similar. Since the name isn\'t a single word, I need to make it one. Combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore makes sense. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor. The ""i*^2"" part could refer to an inhibited dimer. Maybe I can represent this as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is too long. Alternatively, maybe it\'s better to simplify. Since ""EGF-EGFRi"" might mean EGF bound to an inhibited EGFR, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". But the ""*^2"" might indicate a dimer, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". Hmm, but the user wants a single word, so I need to combine them without spaces. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so it\'s about state. So maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" is better, and the ""*^2"" could be ""dimer"" but that\'s another state. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the format as per the name, so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". The ""*^2"" might be a superscript indicating a dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable, but I\'m not sure if it\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_i"" with the understanding that \'i\' stands for inhibited. But the user\'s guidelines say to avoid making significant changes if the term is already interpretable. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", which might be a shorthand. So maybe the best approach is to convert ""EGF-EGFRi"" into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and the ""*^2"" as ""dimer"", so combining them as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But that\'s a bit long, but it\'s a single word.\n\nNow for x87:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"". The \'deg\' likely stands for \'degradation\' or \'degenerate\', but in biological terms, it\'s more about degradation. So the process is the degradation product of the inhibited dimer. So following the same logic as x8, we can take ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" and convert it into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"" or ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded_dimer"". But again, it\'s a single word. Alternatively, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_deg"" but \'deg\' is not as clear. Perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"" is better, indicating the state of being degraded.\n\nWait, but the references for x8 include EGFR and EGF, so the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So in the name, ""EGF-EGFRi"" is the ligand-receptor complex, where the receptor is inhibited. The ""*^2"" is a dimer, so two receptors. So perhaps the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". For x87, it\'s the same but degraded, so ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", which is a single word with the state. So maybe for x8, the term is ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and for x87, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \'i\' in the name stands for \'inhibited\', so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"", and the ""*^2"" is a dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". Then x87, being the degradation product, would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure if \'dimer\' is necessary, or if it\'s implied. Maybe the user just wants ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example uses ""IL6_R_active"", which combines the ligand and receptor with an underscore and then the state. So for x8, since it\'s a reactant, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the product, which is the degradation product, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include the dimer part, so maybe I should consider whether the dimer is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the ""*^2"" is a subscript indicating a dimer, so it\'s part of the term. So ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ""*^2"" is a reference to a specific form, but since the user wants a single word, I need to include it. So perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object would map x8 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and x87 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", so perhaps the format is ligand_receptor_state. So for x8, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the degraded form, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \'deg\' in x87\'s name stands for \'degraded\', so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nI think that\'s the approach to take.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: x11 => x8. Then there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references. The table has two rows: one for reactants (x11) with name ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"", and another for products (x8) with name ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"".\n\nMy task is to map each id (x11 and x8) to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with x11. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". The references are EGF and EGFR. I notice that EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, the term should combine them. Since it\'s the reactant, maybe it\'s the unbound form. So, I\'ll map x11 to ""EGF_L"" because it\'s the ligand before binding.\n\nNow, for x8, the name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" and the references are EGFR and EGF. This seems like the bound form because of the asterisk, which often denotes a bound state in biological equations. So, this would be the receptor-ligand complex. Therefore, I\'ll map x8 to ""EGFR_R_active"" since it\'s the active receptor after binding with the ligand.\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word. ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R_active"" both fit that criterion. I also considered if there\'s a simpler way to represent these, but given the guidelines, combining them with underscores is appropriate.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the guidelines: using single words, combining receptor and ligand with underscores, including the state (active) when necessary, and not making unnecessary changes when the terms are already interpretable. I also made sure to prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency.\n\nSo, the final JSON object should map x11 to ""EGF_L"" and x8 to ""EGFR_R_active"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the interleukin-6 receptor, I should write it as ""IL6_R"". Similarly, if it\'s ""L"", maybe ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the id to the name using the replacement table, and then refine it using references for biological accuracy. So I need to check both the name and reference columns.\n\nLooking at the input equation: DiL00UU equals Di00UU plus L, and it\'s part of the modifiers. The replacement table has three entries. Let\'s look at each id:\n\n1. DiL00UU: It\'s in the role of reactants and modifiers. The name is DiL00UU, and there\'s no reference provided. Since there\'s no additional info, maybe it\'s an abbreviation or a specific term that\'s already interpretable as-is. So perhaps it stays as ""DiL00UU"".\n\n2. Di00UU: This is a product, and the name is the same. The reference is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So according to the guidelines, since the reference is more specific, but the name is ""Di00UU"", I need to check if it\'s a standard abbreviation. If Di00UU is an abbreviation for EGFR, then maybe the term should be ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say if the name is already interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. Wait, but in the example given, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" because it\'s a receptor. Here, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So perhaps Di00UU should be mapped to ""EGFR"" since it\'s the receptor.\n\n3. L: This is a product, name is L, and the reference is EGF, which is Epidermal Growth Factor. Since L is an abbreviation, and it\'s a ligand, according to the guidelines, I should combine the ligand term with ""L"". So maybe ""EGF_L"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the name is a simple abbreviation, and if the term can be identified as a specific receptor or ligand, we should create a single word with an underscore. So for L, since the reference is EGF, which is the ligand, perhaps the term should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because the name for L is just ""L"", but the reference is EGF.

So Di00UU is ""Di00UU"" in the name, but the reference is EGFR. So should I map it to ""EGFR"" or ""EGFR_R""? Since the role is a product, which is a modifier, perhaps it\'s the receptor, so ""EGFR_R"" makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, L is a ligand, so ""EGF_L"".\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, Di00UU is in the products and modifiers, and the reference is EGFR.

If it is, then perhaps the mapping should be to the full term. But if Di00UU is a standard abbreviation, then perhaps it should remain as is. However, the guidelines say to use the name column if possible, but also to use references for accuracy.

Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""x10"" maps to ""EGF"" and ""x11"" to ""EGFR_active"". Hmm, let me think about why that is. The replacement table has \'id\' x10 with name ""EGF-EGFRi"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"". So, the reactant is EGF bound to EGFR inhibitor? Or maybe EGF and EGFR interacting.\n\nWait, the name for x10 is ""EGF-EGFRi"", which might stand for EGF bound to EGFR inhibitor. But the reference is EGF and EGFR. So perhaps x10 is EGF bound to EGFR, making it active. So maybe x10 is EGF, and x11 is the active form of EGFR after binding EGF.\n\nIn the example output, x10 maps to ""EGF"" and x11 maps to ""EGFR_active"". That makes sense because when EGF binds to EGFR, it activates the receptor. So the product x11 would be the active form of EGFR.\n\nI should follow this logic. For each \'id\', first map it using the replacement table, then refine it using the references. So, for x10, the name is ""EGF-EGFRi"" but the reference is ""EGF; EGFR"". So the main term is EGF, so x10 becomes ""EGF"". For x11, the name is ""EGF-EGFRi^2"", but no reference. Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s the active form of EGFR, so ""EGFR_active"".\n\nI think that\'s how the example was derived. I should make sure each term is a single word and use the name column if possible, but also consider the references. Also, if it\'s a ligand-receptor pair, connect them with an underscore, but in this case, the product is the active receptor, so just ""EGFR_active"".\n\nI need to structure the JSON accordingly, with x10 and x11 as keys and their corresponding terms as values. No additional explanations, just the JSON object.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: x1 + x2 => x3. The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1, the name is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should make it a single word. EGF is an acronym for Epidermal Growth Factor, but since it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So x1 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It\'s a receptor, so I need to add ""_R"" to make it clear. So x2 becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, x3 is EGF-EGFR, which is a complex of the ligand and receptor. The name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references confirm both EGF and EGFR. To make it a single word, I\'ll combine them with an underscore, so it becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, should I include the state? The guidelines mention including states if applicable, but in this case, there\'s no state mentioned. So I think it\'s just the complex.\n\nI should also check if there are any ambiguous terms. EGF and EGFR are pretty standard, so no ambiguity here. The references support the terms, so I don\'t need to change anything else.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have x1 as ""EGF"", x2 as ""EGFR_R"", and x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: RP => R2. Then, the replacement table has two rows. The first row is for reactants with id RP, name (EGF_EGFR)2-P, and reference EGFR. The second row is products with id R2, name (EGF_EGFR)2, and references EGF and EGFR.\n\nI need to map each id (RP and R2) to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with RP. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P. The reference is EGFR. Hmm, EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. So, (EGF_EGFR)2-P probably refers to the ligand-receptor complex in a phosphorylated state. The P likely stands for phosphorylated. So, combining EGF and EGFR with an underscore and adding the state, I get ""EGF_EGFR_bound_phosphorylated"".\n\nNow for R2. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2, and the references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like the active form of the complex, maybe after dimerization. So, using the same logic, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. Also, prioritize the name column\'s phrasing. RP\'s name is a bit more specific, so using that for clarity. R2\'s name is simpler but still meaningful.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map RP to ""EGF_EGFR_bound_phosphorylated"" and R2 to ""EGF_EGFR_active"". That should fulfill the user\'s requirements.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see what I have here.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c499 + c529 => c551. Then there\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nLooking at the guidelines, I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include them with an underscore.\n\nStarting with c499. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and the reference is ""EGF; EGFR"". EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So I should combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"". The ""Inh"" might mean inhibited, but the guidelines say to use context. Maybe it\'s not needed here since it\'s already part of the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c529. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The references are empty, so I\'ll rely on the name. ""ErbB1"" is the same as EGFR, and ""h"" could stand for the homo dimer or perhaps the receptor in a certain state. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe it\'s an active state. So I can combine as ""EGFR_ATP"".\n\nNow, c551. The name is a complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:Inh::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". The product is a combination of c499 and c529. Since they\'re both EGF and EGFR, the product would be a complex. So I\'ll combine them with an underscore: ""EGF_EGFR_complex"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word. I think I\'ve done that by combining with underscores. Also, I\'m not adding any states unless they\'re part of the name. I\'m keeping it simple as per the guidelines, so no extra changes unless necessary.\n\nLet me double-check. c499: EGF and EGFR, so EGF_EGFR. c529: EGFR with ATP, so EGFR_ATP. c551: the complex of both, so EGFR_EGFR_complex. Yeah, that makes sense. I think that\'s the correct mapping.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c500, c105, and c115. Each has a name and references. My goal is to map each id to a single word term, possibly combining receptors and ligands with an underscore, or adding states like 'bound' or 'active'.\n\nLooking at c500, the name is a complex: (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh). The references are EGF, ATP, and EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (which is EGFR). The structure seems to be EGF bound to EGFR with ATP and Inh (which I think is an inhibitor). Since it's a complex, maybe it's in an active state because ATP is a common energy source for activation. So I can combine ligand and receptor as EGF_EGFR and add 'active' as a state. That gives EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNext, c105's name is ATP with a concentration (1.2e9), but the references are empty. Since it's just ATP, and there's no additional info, I'll keep it as ATP. It's a simple term, so no need to change it.\n\nFor c115, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh)-HalfActive. The references are empty here too. The structure is similar to c500 but it's half-active. So, using the same ligand and receptor combination, I get EGF_EGFR, and since it's half-active, the term becomes EGF_EGFR_halfactive.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, so I use underscores to join parts. Also, I prioritize the name column's phrasing for consistency. I didn't find any ambiguity here, so the terms are straightforward.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its term. I think I've covered all the guidelines, so let me put it all together."", 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` refers to a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and add them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. For each `id`, I should first map it to its `name` and then use the references to refine it if necessary. If the `name` is already clear, I might not need to change it. But if the `name` is an abbreviation or ambiguous, I should use the references to find a better term.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is c140 + c499 => c493.\n\nThe replacement table has:\n- c140: ErbB3\n- c499: EGF:ErbB1:Inh with references EGF; EGFR\n- c493: EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3 with references EGF; EGFR\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s go one by one.\n\nStarting with c140: The name is ErbB3, and the references don\'t provide additional info. Since ErbB3 is a known receptor tyrosine kinase, I can use it as is. So c140 maps to ""ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c499: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF; EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term ""Inh"" might refer to an inhibitor or maybe indicates inhibition. But in this context, it\'s part of the name. So I need to interpret this correctly. The name suggests a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and Inh. But considering the references, EGFR is the same as ErbB1. So perhaps it\'s EGF bound to EGFR (ErbB1) and maybe an inhibitor. But since the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, I should make it a single term. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, combine with an underscore. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, I should connect them. But the ""Inh"" part complicates it. Looking at the references, they don\'t provide more info, so I have to go with the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"".\n\nThen, c493: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, and references are EGF; EGFR. Similar to c499 but includes ErB3. So it\'s EGF, ErbB1, Inh, and ErB3. ErbB3 is another receptor. So perhaps this is a complex involving EGF, EGFR (ErbB1), an inhibitor, and ErbB3. Combining these into a single term, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nWait, but the references for c493 are the same as c499, just EGF and EGFR. So maybe the name is EGF bound to ErbB1, with an inhibitor, and also involving ErbB3. So perhaps it\'s a trimeric complex or something similar. But since the name is given as EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, I should follow that. So combining all with underscores, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nBut I should check if any of these can be simplified. For c499, maybe the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, which could be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". Similarly, c493 is ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that ""Inh"" might stand for inhibitor, perhaps it\'s an EGF-ErbB1 complex with an inhibitor, but without more context, I have to go with the name provided.\n\nSo, compiling this into JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c140"": ""ErbB3"",\n  ""c499"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"",\n  ""c493"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the provided data.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c149 is a reactant with the name (ErbB1:ErbB3)_P. The references are empty, so I need to rely on the name. ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors, so I think they form a heterodimer here. The ""_P"" might indicate phosphorylation, so I should combine them with an underscore and add ""_active"" or something. Maybe ""ErbB1_ErbB3_active"" makes sense because it\'s a bound state.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a concentration of 1.2e9. The name is straightforward, so I don\'t need to change it. It\'s a ligand, so maybe ""ATP_L"" would be appropriate, indicating it\'s a ligand.\n\nThen, c127 is a product with the name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3:ATP and references EGF and EGFR. Since EGF is the ligand binding to the receptors ErbB1 and ErbB3, and ATP is involved, the product term should reflect the active state. So combining EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, and ATP as a complex, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_ATP_bound"" would work, indicating the bound state of the complex.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so using underscores is the way to go. Also, considering states like ""active"" or ""bound"" helps in making the terms more interpretable. I should avoid making unnecessary changes if the term is already clear, but in this case, creating combinations makes it more accurate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term as I thought.

The IDs are s123, s129, and s3. The names are all EGFR and EGF. The references are the same as the names, so I don\'t need to look elsewhere for synonyms.\n\nSo, for each ID, I need to map it to its name, but considering if it\'s a receptor or ligand. EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand. So, s123 and s129 are EGFR, which is the receptor, so they should be EGFR_R. s3 is EGF, the ligand, so it should be EGF_L.\n\nBut wait, the guidelines also say that if the term is simple and interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it much. EGFR is already a standard abbreviation, so maybe I can just use EGFR without adding the ""_R"" suffix? Hmm, but the example given used R and L for receptors and ligands, so I think I should follow that.\n\nSo, s123 and s129 are both EGFR, so they become EGFR_R. s3 is EGF, so it becomes EGF_L.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term.

The references for both are ""EGF; EGFR"". \n\nI need to map each \'id\' to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with x4. The name is EGF-EGFR squared. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, I should combine them as ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R"". But since they are bound, I should add ""_bound"" to indicate the state. So x4 becomes ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_bound"".\n\nFor x5, the name is similar but with a star instead of a caret. The star might indicate a different state, perhaps active.

The references don\'t add new information, just synonyms. So I should stick with the \'name\' column\'s phrasing.\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, so underscores are okay.

But the guidelines say to make it a single word, so I\'ll join them with underscores: EGFR_RasGAP.\n\nNext, Rp: It\'s a product with references EGF and EGFR. Since EGFR is the receptor, Rp is likely EGFR. So the term is EGFR.\n\nThen, RasGAP: It\'s a product with no references, but it\'s a known protein. So it remains RasGAP.\n\nLastly, mIRSp_SHP2: It\'s a modifier with no name or references.

According to the guidelines, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor. Therefore, the term should be ""EGF_ErbB1"".\n\n2. **E_E1_PT**: This is a product, with the name E_E1_p-PTP-1B. The references column is empty, so I rely on the name. It seems like this is the phosphorylated form of E_E1 bound to PTP-1B. According to the guidelines, if there are states like active or bound, I should include them with an underscore. So, the term becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_p-PTP-1B"".\n\n3. **ERKstar**: The role is modifiers, the name is ERK*, and the reference is ERK*. ERK* typically denotes the phosphorylated or active form of ERK. Since the name already uses an asterisk, which is a common shorthand for active, I can represent this as ""ERK_active"".\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, so I\'m using underscores to join parts. For E_E1, since it\'s a receptor-ligand pair, I connected them. For E_E1_PT, I kept the p (phosphorylated) and PTP-1B as part of the term. ERKstar is simplified to ERK_active for clarity.\n\nNow, compiling these into a JSON object:\n\n- E_E1 maps to ""EGF_ErbB1""\n- E_E1_PT maps to ""EGF_ErbB1_p-PTP-1B""\n- ERKstar maps to ""ERK_active""\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Let me double-check if any terms need further refinement. EGF_ErbB1 is clear. EGF_ErbB1_p-PTP-1B includes the state and the associated protein, which is accurate. ERK_active is a standard way to denote the active form, so that\'s appropriate.\n\nI don\'t see any issues, so the JSON should look like this.', '', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the guidelines and the input data provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table, there are three entries:\n\n1. species_25 is EGF, with the reference also being EGF.\n2. species_1 is freeEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n3. species_0 is boundEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term should be a single word, and if possible, receptors and ligands should be connected with an underscore. Also, if there are states like bound or active, they should be included with an underscore.\n\nStarting with species_25: the name is EGF, which is already a single word and a well-known ligand. There\'s no need to change it, so it maps directly to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, species_1 is freeEGFReceptor. The name is already descriptive, but according to the guidelines, if we can identify a specific receptor or ligand, we should use an underscore. The reference for this is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, freeEGFReceptor can be simplified to ""EGFR"" because it\'s the receptor for EGF. Since it\'s the receptor, we don\'t need the ""Receptor"" part; just ""EGFR"" suffices.\n\nThen, species_0 is boundEGFReceptor. Again, the reference is EGFR. Since this is the bound state, we can include ""bound"" as part of the term. So, following the guideline, we would combine the receptor name with the state: ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nWait, but looking back, the guidelines mention that if the name is already simple and interpretable, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. However, in this case, species_1 and species_0 both have the same reference, EGFR. So, perhaps species_1 is the free form and species_0 is the bound form. Therefore, mapping species_1 to ""EGFR"" and species_0 to ""EGFR_bound"" makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there\'s any ambiguity. The name for species_1 is ""freeEGFReceptor"", which clearly indicates it\'s the free form of the receptor. The name for species_0 is ""boundEGFReceptor"", indicating it\'s bound to EGF. So, mapping them to ""EGFR"" and ""EGFR_bound"" respectively seems appropriate.\n\nDouble-checking the guidelines: we need to use the name column first, but if the reference provides a more specific term, we can use that. In this case, the name for species_1 is ""freeEGFReceptor"", but the reference is EGFR, so we should use ""EGFR"" as the term for species_1. Similarly, species_0\'s name is ""boundEGFReceptor"", but using ""EGFR_bound"" aligns with the reference and the guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should map:\n- species_25 to ""EGF""\n- species_1 to ""EGFR""\n- species_0 to ""EGFR_bound""\n\nI think that\'s correct. It follows the guidelines, uses the references appropriately, and keeps each term as a single word where possible, with the state included for the bound form.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c159 => c86. So, I need to map both c159 and c86 to their respective terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), and the references are EGF and EGFR. The role is reactants. For c86, the name is R_degraded, with no references provided, and the role is products.\n\nStarting with c159: The name is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since the guidelines suggest combining ligand and receptor with an underscore, I should consider the ligand first. EGF is the ligand, so I\'ll take ""EGF"" as the ligand part. Now, for the receptors, ErbB1 is also known as EGFR, which is the primary receptor for EGF. ErbB2 is another receptor that can form heterodimers with EGFR. So, in this case, the primary receptor is EGFR (ErbB1), and ErbB2 is a co-receptor.\n\nBut the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so I think the main interaction here is EGF binding to EGFR. The presence of ErbB2 might indicate a dimerization, but for the purpose of creating a single word, I should focus on the main components. So, combining the ligand EGF with the receptor EGFR would give ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2). So, perhaps it\'s more accurate to represent it as a complex. Since the guideline says to create a single word by connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore, I think ""EGF_EGFR"" makes sense because EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. ErbB2 might be part of the receptor complex, but since EGFR is the primary, maybe we can just use EGFR for the receptor part. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, and ErbB2 is another receptor, perhaps we can denote the complex as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2, but that\'s more than two parts. But the guideline says to make a single word, so perhaps just the primary ligand and receptor: EGF_EGFR.\n\nNow, looking at c86: the name is R_degraded. The references are empty. The role is products. So, R is likely a receptor. Since in the equation, c159 is a reactant, and c86 is a product, it\'s probably the degradation product of the receptor. So, R_degraded would be the degraded form of the receptor. From c159, we identified that the receptor is EGFR, so R in c86 would correspond to EGFR. Therefore, the term would be ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map c159 to ""EGF_EGFR"" and c86 to ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. However, in this case, c159 is mapped to (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), which is a complex, so it\'s better to make it more interpretable. Similarly, R_degraded is ambiguous, so we need to specify which receptor it is, which we can infer from the reactants.\n\nSo, yes, the mapping would be:\n\n{\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c86"": ""EGFR_degraded""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach. I considered the guidelines, the context from the equation, and the replacement table to make these substitutions accurately.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: the equation is c1 + c2 => c3, and the replacement table has three entries.\n\nFor c1, the id is \'c1\', the name is \'EGF\', and the reference is \'EGF\'. EGF is a known ligand, so I should represent it as a single word. Since it\'s a ligand, maybe it should be \'EGF_L\'. But the guidelines say if it\'s simple, don\'t change it. So perhaps just \'EGF\' is okay, but since it\'s a ligand, maybe the \'L\' suffix is better. I\'ll go with \'EGF_L\'.\n\nNext, c2 is \'ErbB1:ATP\' with references \'ATP; EGFR\'. ErbB1 is the same as EGFR, the epidermal growth factor receptor. So this is the receptor part. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe I should represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s more than a single word. Wait, the guidelines say each term should be a single word, so I need to combine them. So maybe \'EGFR_R_ATP\' or \'EGFR_ATP_R\'. Hmm, but the main thing is to indicate it\'s the receptor and bound to ATP. So I\'ll make it \'EGFR_R_ATP\'.\n\nFor c3, the product is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\' with references \'EGF; ATP; EGFR\'. This is the complex of EGF, EGFR, and ATP. Since it\'s a product, it\'s the bound state. So I should represent it as a single term. It\'s the EGF ligand bound to the EGFR receptor with ATP. So maybe \'EGF_EGFR_R_ATP_bound\' but that\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency. So for c3, the name is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\', which is a complex. So maybe I should combine them as \'EGF_EGFR_R_ATP\' but ensure it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since it\'s the product, it\'s in a bound state, so maybe \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' is better.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to include states like \'bound\' or \'active\' with an underscore. So for c3, it\'s the product, which is the bound form. So perhaps the term should be \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- c1: EGF_L\n- c2: EGFR_R_ATP\n- c3: EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\n\nBut wait, I\'m not sure if \'EGFR_R_ATP\' is the best term for c2. Since c2 is ErbB1:ATP, which is the receptor bound to ATP, maybe it\'s better to represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but as a single word. However, the guidelines say each term must be a single word, so I can\'t have spaces. So perhaps \'EGFR_R_boundATP\' but that\'s not standard. Alternatively, just \'EGFR_R_ATP\' as separate parts but as a single term.\n\nI think the best approach is to represent each component clearly. For c2, since it\'s the receptor bound to ATP, \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' would be the full term, but as a single word, it\'s \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' without spaces. But I\'m not sure if that\'s acceptable. Alternatively, maybe just \'EGFR_ATP\' as the term, but that might be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for c2, since it\'s a receptor, we can represent it as \'EGFR_R\' and for the bound ATP, include it as part of the term. So maybe \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. However, the guidelines allow for including states with underscores, so that should be fine.\n\nWait, the example given was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"". So in that case, the receptor is identified by \'R\' and ligand by \'L\'. So for c2, which is ErbB1:ATP, which is the receptor bound to ATP, maybe we can represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' as a single term, using underscores to separate parts.\n\nSimilarly, for c3, which is the product of EGF, EGFR, and ATP, it\'s the bound state. So combining all parts with underscores, it would be \'EGF_EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but as a single term.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example shows that when you have a receptor, you add \'_R\' and for ligand \'_L\'. So for c1, which is EGF, a ligand, it\'s \'EGF_L\'. For c2, which is the receptor (ErbB1/EGFR) bound to ATP, it\'s \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\'. And for c3, the product, which is the complex, it\'s \'EGF_EGFR_R_bound_ATP\'.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the product should be a separate term or just the combination. The product is the result of the reaction, so it\'s the bound form of EGF, EGFR, and ATP. So perhaps the term should reflect that it\'s the bound state, so \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \'EGF_EGFR_bound_ATP\' but I think including \'bound\' as part of the term is more accurate.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to these terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c11, c105, and c126. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and some references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c11 has the name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". The guidelines say that if we can identify a receptor or ligand, we should combine them with an underscore. Here, EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, which is also known as EGFR. So, EGF binds to EGFR. Since ATP is part of the complex, but it\'s an enzyme component, maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s activity. So, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references. The name is a bit ambiguous because it\'s just ATP with a number. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as is. So, I\'ll map c105 to ""ATP"" since it\'s already a known term.\n\nFor c126, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1):ATP"" with references ""EGF; EGFR"". Again, EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR). The "":ATP"" might indicate the receptor\'s active state with ATP bound. So, combining them and adding the state, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have c11 as ""EGF_EGFR"", c105 as ""ATP"", and c126 as ""EGF_EGFR_active"".', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher.

Each term in the JSON should be a single word. If it's a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, if the id is R, it becomes IL6_R. Also, if there are states like bound or active, I should include those with underscores too.\n\nThe input they've given includes an equation and a replacement table. The equation is x6 + x16 => x10. The replacement table has three rows:\n\n- x6 is EGFRi with reference EGFR\n- x16 is EGFi with reference EGF\n- x10 is EGF-EGFRi with references EGFR and EGF\n\nI need to map each id to a biologically meaningful term. Let's take each id one by one.\n\nStarting with x6. The name is EGFRi, and the reference is EGFR. Hmm, EGFRi might stand for EGFR inhibitor. But in biological terms, EGFR is a receptor, so EGFRi could be the inhibited form of the receptor. So maybe I should denote it as EGFR_inhibited.\n\nNext, x16 is EGFi, with reference EGF. EGF is a ligand, so EGFi might be the inhibited form of the ligand. That would translate to EGF_inhibited.\n\nThen, x10 is EGF-EGFRi, with references EGFR and EGF. This seems like a complex of EGF bound to the inhibited EGFR. So it would be EGF bound to EGFR, which is inhibited. So the term would be EGF_bound_EGFR_inhibited.\n\nWait, but according to the guidelines, if a receptor and ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. So for x10, it's a complex, so maybe EGF_EGFR. But since it's inhibited, I should add 'inhibited' as a state.\n\nLet me double-check. The name is EGF-EGFRi, which suggests EGF bound to EGFRi. So combining them with an underscore and adding the state gives EGF_EGFR_inhibited.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to these terms. So x6 is EGFR_inhibited, x16 is EGF_inhibited, and x10 is EGF_EGFR_inhibited.\n\nI think that makes sense.

Since R stands for receptor, and it\'s degraded, the term would be R_degraded. But looking at the guidelines, I should use specific names if possible. However, since the references are empty, I can\'t get a more specific name. So, R_degraded is acceptable.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map c161 to EGF and c86 to R_degraded.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a ligand or receptor can be identified, use the specific name. For c161, the ligand is EGF, so that\'s straightforward. For c86, it\'s R_degraded, which is a specific term.

The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as the free form of the EGFR receptor. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is unless necessary. However, since the name is freeEGFR, it\'s more precise to use the full term. But wait, the guideline says if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s better not to change it. So maybe fEGFR should just be ""EGFR"" because the name is freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. Hmm, perhaps ""EGFR_free"" or ""EGFR"" itself. But the replacement table\'s name is freeEGFR, which might suggest it\'s the free form, but in the guidelines, if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. So I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\' is fEGFR, and the \'name\' is freeEGFR. The reference is EGFR. So maybe I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is just a state. But according to the guidelines, if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t make changes. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, but perhaps it\'s better to use the full term. But the guidelines say not to make significant changes if the term is an abbreviation or is interpretable. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. So perhaps the correct term is ""EGFR"".\n\nThen EGF. The \'id\' is EGF, the \'name\' is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, and the name is EGF, which is a common abbreviation, it\'s better to keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR.

EGF is straightforward as it\'s the ligand.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". The replacement table has ""bEGFR"" in the reactants with the name ""boundEGFR"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"". The products have ""null"" for both name and references.\n\nHmm, so the input equation is bEGFR => null. That suggests that bEGFR is transforming into something, but the product is null. But in the replacement table, the product\'s id is null, which probably means it\'s an empty product, like nothing is produced. So, in the JSON, the key is ""bEGFR"" and the value should be the interpretable term.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for id ""bEGFR"", the name is ""boundEGFR"". The references are EGF and EGFR. So, ""boundEGFR"" is the name, but I need to make sure it\'s a single word. ""boundEGFR"" is already one word, so that should work. I don\'t need to change it because it\'s specific and clear. Also, the guideline says if it\'s already interpretable, don\'t make changes.\n\nWait, but in the example, ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". So in the JSON, the key is ""bEGFR"" and the value is ""boundEGFR"". The products have ""null"" as the id, but the name is also null.

I don\'t see a need to modify it further.\n\nSo, the JSON object should have ""bEGFR"" as the key and ""boundEGFR"" as the value. I don\'t need to include the null id because it\'s not mapped to anything in the equation, just the transformation from bEGFR to nothing.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K. The references for bEGFR are EGFR and EGF, which are the receptor and ligand. So maybe I need to use those references to figure out the receptor and ligand terms.\n\nThey also mentioned considering states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and including them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". In the replacement table, the names include ""boundEGFR"", so maybe that\'s a state. \n\nLooking at the input equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. So the reactants are boundEGFR and PI3K, and the products are the same boundEGFR and phosphorylated PI3K. \n\nThe replacement table has bEGFR mapped to boundEGFR, which refers to EGFR (the receptor) and EGF (the ligand). So perhaps bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, meaning the receptor is bound by EGF. Therefore, the term could be ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nFor PI3K, the name is PI3K, and there\'s no reference. Since it\'s a kinase, maybe it\'s just ""PI3K"" as it is. The products have pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K, so that would be ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nWait, but the user said if a term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. So PI3K is fine as is, but pPI3K should become ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. For bEGFR, since it\'s bound, it\'s ""EGFR_bound"". PI3K stays as ""PI3K"". pPI3K becomes ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. Each id is mapped correctly, and the terms are single words with states included when necessary.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c164 + c105 => c125. Each of these ids (c164, c105, c125) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c164, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it's a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB4. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB4_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the references are empty. The guidelines mention that if a term is simple or reasonably interpretable, we don't change it much. So ATP is a standard term, so I can just use ATP.\n\nFor c125, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP, and the references are EGF and EGFR. The role is product. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. So, the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4, along with ATP. Since it's a product, it might be the active form. So, the term could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines suggest that if states like active or bound are present, they should be included. So, perhaps the term should reflect that the complex is active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have each id as a key with the corresponding term as the value."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c6 + c16 => c10. The replacement table has three entries: c6 is ErbB1:ATP, c16 is EGF, and c10 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. The references for c10 include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. \n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with c6. The name is ErbB1:ATP. I know that ErbB1 is another name for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). So, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is a ligand or a molecule it binds. Since the guidelines suggest that if receptor and ligand can be identified, we connect them with an underscore. So, ErbB1 would be the receptor, and ATP the ligand. But wait, ErbB1:ATP might already be a specific term, so maybe it\'s better to keep it as is since it\'s a single word. Or perhaps we need to split it into receptor and ligand.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So ErbB1:ATP might be a specific term, so we can keep it as c6: ""ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nNext, c16 is EGF. EGF is a well-known ligand for EGFR. Since it\'s a single word and a standard abbreviation, we can keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nNow, c10 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which combines EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. From the references, it includes EGF, ATP, and EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1, so it\'s the same as ErbB1. So the complex here is EGF bound to ErbB1 along with ATP. Since the guidelines suggest including states like bound or active, perhaps we should represent this as a bound state.\n\nSo, considering the interaction, EGF binds to ErbB1 (EGFR), which then binds ATP. So the complex would be EGF bound to ErbB1, which is active. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"". But looking at the references, it includes EGF, ATP, and EGFR, which implies that the active form with ATP is part of the product. So perhaps the active state is important here.\n\nAlternatively, since the product is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which might indicate the receptor-ligand complex with ATP. So maybe it\'s the active form of the receptor with the ligand. So the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc6: ""ErbB1_ATP"" (since it\'s ErbB1 with ATP)\nc16: ""EGF"" (as it\'s a ligand)\nc10: ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" (since it\'s the active complex with EGF and ErbB1, which is EGFR)\n\nI think that makes sense. So the JSON would map each id accordingly.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c10 + c155 => c159. So, c10 and c155 are reactants, and c159 is the product.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each id has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c10: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and the references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. The guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, use an underscore. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, EGF_L and EGFR_R. But wait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. Hmm, maybe it\'s EGF bound to EGFR with ATP? So perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest including states like ""active"" or ""bound"" as part of the term with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L_bound_to_EGFR_R or something like that. But the example given was ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps the format is ligand_L or receptor_R.\n\nWait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So it\'s ligand followed by _L or receptor followed by _R. So for c10, which is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R. But since it\'s all together, perhaps the term should reflect that. But the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. Maybe EGF_ErbB1_ATP? But that\'s three parts. Alternatively, since EGF binds to EGFR, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R, but the name is a combination. Hmm, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR since that\'s a common term.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which is the ligand, receptor, and ATP. Maybe it\'s the active form of the receptor. So perhaps EGF_EGFR_active. But the guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nBut the references include EGFR, so maybe the term should be EGFR. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so perhaps it\'s the complex. But I\'m supposed to make a single word. So maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c155: The name is ErbB2, and references are empty. Since it\'s a receptor, perhaps it\'s ErbB2_R. But wait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"", so the receptor is denoted with _R. So maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nBut the name is just ErbB2, so perhaps it\'s sufficient as ErbB2. Alternatively, if it\'s a receptor, maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nNow, c159: The name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), references include EGF and EGFR. So this is the product, which is a trimer of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe c10 can be EGF_EGFR, c155 is ErbB2, and c159 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nBut let me check the guidelines again. For c10, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 (EGFR) with ATP. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active. But the example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe for c10, it\'s EGF_L and EGFR_R, but since it\'s a combination, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR.\n\nWait, but the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. So perhaps EGF_EGFR is acceptable.\n\nFor c155, since the name is ErbB2 and there\'s no reference, maybe it\'s ErbB2_R as it\'s a receptor.\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so it\'s a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nBut the references for c159 include EGF and EGFR, so perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nHmm, I think I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR for c10, ErbB2_R for c155, and EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 for c159.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the product was ""IL6_R_active"". So maybe c159 should have a state like ""active"" or ""bound"". But the name doesn\'t specify that, so perhaps it\'s just the complex.\n\nAlternatively, since it\'s the product, it\'s the active form, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active.\n\nBut the guidelines say to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term with an underscore. So if the product is the active form, maybe include that.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the name indicates that. The name is just the components, so maybe it\'s just the complex without a state.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\nc10: EGF_EGFR\nc155: ErbB2_R\nc159: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2\n\nWait, but the references for c10 include EGFR, so maybe it\'s better to use EGFR instead of ErbB1. So c10 would be EGF_EGFR.\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c155"": ""ErbB2_R"",\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""\n}\n\nBut wait, in the example, the product was ""IL6_R_active"". So maybe c159 should have a state. But since the name doesn\'t specify, I\'m not sure. Maybe it\'s just the complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps c159 is the active form, so it could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active.\n\nBut without specific info, I think it\'s safer to just use the components.\n\nSo, final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c155"": ""ErbB2_R"",\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""\n}', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c500, c105, and c115. Each has a name and references. My goal is to map each id to a single word term, possibly combining receptors and ligands with an underscore, or adding states like 'bound' or 'active'.\n\nLooking at c500, the name is a complex: (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh). The references are EGF, ATP, and EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (which is EGFR). The structure seems to be EGF bound to EGFR with ATP and Inh (which I think is an inhibitor). Since it's a complex, maybe it's in an active state because ATP is a common energy source for activation. So I can combine ligand and receptor as EGF_EGFR and add 'active' as a state. That gives EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNext, c105's name is ATP with a concentration (1.2e9), but the references are empty. Since it's just ATP, and there's no additional info, I'll keep it as ATP. It's a simple term, so no need to change it.\n\nFor c115, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh)-HalfActive. The references are empty here too. The structure is similar to c500 but it's half-active. So, using the same ligand and receptor combination, I get EGF_EGFR, and since it's half-active, the term becomes EGF_EGFR_halfactive.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, so I use underscores to join parts. Also, I prioritize the name column's phrasing for consistency. I didn't find any ambiguity here, so the terms are straightforward.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its term. I think I've covered all the guidelines, so let me put it all together."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c161 + c105 => c125. There\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c161, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), and references are EGF and EGFR. I know that EGF stands for Epidermal Growth Factor. ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. EGF typically binds to ErbB1, which is also called EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor). So, the complex here is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. But in reality, EGF mainly binds to ErbB1, so maybe the term should reflect that.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9, and there are no references. Since it\'s ATP, a common molecule, it\'s straightforward. I don\'t need to change it unless it\'s an abbreviation, but in this case, ATP is a standard term, so it should stay as is.\n\nFor c125, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP, with references EGF and EGFR. This seems like the product after ATP binds to the EGF-receptor complex. Since ATP is involved, maybe it\'s part of a signaling pathway, like ATP binding to the receptor after EGF.\n\nNow, following the guidelines:\n\n- Each term must be a single word. So, for complexes, I should combine them with underscores. For example, EGF and the receptor would be EGF_ErbB1. But since ErbB1 is the primary receptor, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1.\n\nWait, in the example given, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So, the format is ligand_receptor or something similar. For c161, it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. But ErbB1 is the main receptor for EGF. ErbB4 usually binds other ligands like neuregulins. So, perhaps c161 should be EGF_ErbB1, and ErbB4 might not be part of this complex in this context.\n\nWait, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), so all three are part of the complex. Maybe it\'s a dimer. So, perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified specifically, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4. But since it\'s a complex, maybe the term should reflect that.\n\nWait, the guidelines also mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map the id to name, then refine using references. So, c161 maps to (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), but the references say EGF and EGFR. So, maybe the correct term is EGF_EGFR, since EGFR is ErbB1.\n\nWait, EGFR is the same as ErbB1, so maybe the complex is EGF_EGFR. But the name includes ErbB4 as well. That\'s confusing. I\'m not sure if ErbB4 is part of the complex here or not.\n\nLooking up, EGF primarily binds to ErbB1 (EGFR), and sometimes forms heterodimers with other receptors like ErbB2, ErbB3, or ErbB4. But in this case, the name specifically includes ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, perhaps the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the guidelines suggest that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, if it\'s EGF and the receptor, it\'s EGF_ErbB1. But since there are two receptors, maybe it\'s a bit more complex.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), perhaps it\'s best to keep it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term. Maybe I should simplify it to EGF_EGFR, as that\'s a common way to denote the EGF receptor.\n\nWait, the references for c161 are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps the name should be EGF_EGFR, as that\'s a more standard term. The presence of ErbB4 might be part of the complex but perhaps not the primary focus here.\n\nFor c105, since it\'s ATP, it remains as ATP.\n\nFor c125, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP. So, after the complex binds ATP, maybe the term is EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound or something similar. But the guidelines suggest using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term. So, perhaps EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound.\n\nBut the references for c125 are EGF and EGFR, same as c161. So, maybe the term is EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nWait, the initial complex c161 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), which I\'m now considering as EGF_EGFR. So, c125 would be EGF_EGFR bound to ATP, so EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc161: EGF_EGFR\nc105: ATP\nc125: EGF_EGFR_ATP\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure about including ErbB4. Maybe it\'s better to stick with the name provided, which includes ErbB1 and ErbB4. So, perhaps the terms should reflect that.\n\nAlternatively, since the references for c161 are EGF and EGFR, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR, and c125 would be EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nWait, but the name for c161 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), so it\'s a ternary complex. So, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nSimilarly, for c125, it\'s that complex plus ATP, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term. It might be too long. Maybe the primary receptor is ErbB1, so EGF_EGFR, and c125 is EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps c125 is the same as c161 but with ATP bound, so EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nBut the name includes ATP, so maybe it\'s better to include it.\n\nI think I\'ll go with:\n\nc161: EGF_ErbB1\nc105: ATP\nc125: EGF_ErbB1_ATP\n\nBut considering the guidelines, I should make it a single word with underscores. So, EGF_ErbB1, ATP, EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, since c161\'s references are EGF and EGFR, maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nSo, final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c161"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c125"": ""EGF_EGFR_ATP""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident about including ErbB4. Maybe it\'s better to include all receptors as per the name. So, c161: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4, c125: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut that\'s a longer term, and the guidelines prefer single words, but with underscores. So, it\'s acceptable as it\'s a single term with underscores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1 as the primary, and c125 as EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nI think I\'ll go with the shorter version since EGFR is a common term, and ErbB4 might not be the primary here.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c3 + c499 => c500. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c3, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references include EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n- For c499, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" with references EGF and EGFR.\n- For c500, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"" and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term in the JSON must be a single word. So, I need to convert these into single words, possibly using underscores.\n\nFor c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The guideline suggests that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor. So, combining them gives ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSimilarly, for c499, the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh. Inh might stand for inhibited or inhibitor. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_inh"".\n\nFor c500, the name is a combination of ATP and Inh. Since c500 is the product, it\'s a complex of the two. So, combining the terms from c3 and c499, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word with underscores as needed. Also, I should check if the references suggest any other terms, but in this case, EGF and EGFR are consistent across all references, so I\'ll stick with those.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- c3: EGF_EGFR\n- c499: EGF_EGFR_inh\n- c500: EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh\n\nThat should cover all the ids with biologically interpretable terms as single words.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Each id needs to be mapped based on the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c143, the name is ErbB4. Since it\'s a known receptor, I can map it directly. So id ""c143"" becomes ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c3\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and the references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. The guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So combining them, I get ""EGF_L"" for the ligand part and ""EGFR_R"" for the receptor. But since the name has multiple components, maybe I need to represent both. Wait, the guidelines suggest if it\'s a simple R or L, connect with an underscore. But in this case, it\'s more complex. Perhaps it\'s better to take the most relevant part. The references include EGFR, which is the receptor, so maybe c3 is the ligand, so ""EGF_L"" makes sense.\n\nThen, c147\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4"" with references EGF and EGFR. So it\'s similar to c3 but includes ErbB4. Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a complex. Perhaps combining the ligand and receptors: ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"". That seems a bit long, but it includes all components.\n\nWait, the guidelines say each term should be a single word, so underscores are allowed. So combining all the parts into a single term with underscores is acceptable. Therefore, c147 becomes ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"".\n\nI should check if any of the names are ambiguous. ErbB4 is straightforward. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So mapping c3 as ""EGF_L"" makes sense because it\'s the ligand part of the complex.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would have c143 as ""ErbB4"", c3 as ""EGF_L"", and c147 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

For each `id`, I should first map it to its `name` and then use the references to refine it if necessary. If the `name` is already clear, I might not need to change it.

Let\'s go one by one.\n\nStarting with c140: The name is ErbB3, and the references don\'t provide additional info. Since ErbB3 is a known receptor tyrosine kinase, I can use it as is. So c140 maps to ""ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c499: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF; EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term ""Inh"" might refer to an inhibitor or maybe indicates inhibition. But in this context, it\'s part of the name. So I need to interpret this correctly. The name suggests a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and Inh. But considering the references, EGFR is the same as ErbB1. So perhaps it\'s EGF bound to EGFR (ErbB1) and maybe an inhibitor. But since the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, I should make it a single term. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, combine with an underscore. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, I should connect them. But the ""Inh"" part complicates it. Looking at the references, they don\'t provide more info, so I have to go with the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"".\n\nThen, c493: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, and references are EGF; EGFR. Similar to c499 but includes ErB3. So it\'s EGF, ErbB1, Inh, and ErB3. ErbB3 is another receptor. So perhaps this is a complex involving EGF, EGFR (ErbB1), an inhibitor, and ErbB3. Combining these into a single term, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nWait, but the references for c493 are the same as c499, just EGF and EGFR. So maybe the name is EGF bound to ErbB1, with an inhibitor, and also involving ErbB3. So perhaps it\'s a trimeric complex or something similar. But since the name is given as EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB3, I should follow that. So combining all with underscores, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nBut I should check if any of these can be simplified. For c499, maybe the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, which could be ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"". Similarly, c493 is ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that ""Inh"" might stand for inhibitor, perhaps it\'s an EGF-ErbB1 complex with an inhibitor, but without more context, I have to go with the name provided.\n\nSo, compiling this into JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c140"": ""ErbB3"",\n  ""c499"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"",\n  ""c493"": ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh_ErbB3""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the provided data.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c164 + c105 => c125. There are three ids here: c164, c105, and c125. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c164. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB4)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB4 is another receptor. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be a single word combining these. Since both are receptors, I can write them as EGFR_ErbB4_P. That makes sense because it\'s a complex of EGFR and ErbB4 in a phosphorylated state.\n\nNext, c105. The name is ""ATP 1.2e9"". Hmm, the number 1.2e9 is probably a concentration or something, but since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as is. So c105 should just be ""ATP"".\n\nNow, c125. The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4):ATP"", and the references mention EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So this is a complex of EGF, EGFR, and ErbB4 bound to ATP. To make it a single word, I\'ll combine the ligand and receptors with underscores. The ligand is EGF, and the receptors are EGFR and ErbB4. So it would be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP. But wait, the guidelines mention adding states like bound or active if necessary. In this case, the term includes the ligand and receptors along with ATP, which might imply a bound state. But since the name already includes all components, maybe just combining them is sufficient. Alternatively, maybe we can add \'bound\' to indicate the state, so it becomes EGF_EGFR_ErbB4_bound_ATP. But I\'m not sure if \'bound\' is necessary here. The example given in the guidelines was ""IL6_R_active"", so maybe adding \'bound\' is appropriate when a ligand is involved. So perhaps the term should include \'bound\' to indicate the ligand is attached. So the term would be EGF_bound_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP. But wait, that might be too long. Alternatively, since ATP is part of the product, perhaps it\'s already implied that it\'s bound. I think combining the components with underscores is the way to go, so EGF_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map c164 to ""EGFR_ErbB4_P"", c105 to ""ATP"", and c125 to ""EGF_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP"".\n\nWait, but looking back at the example, the user provided an output where c125 was ""EGF_bound_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP"". So perhaps adding \'bound\' is necessary when the ligand is present. So I\'ll adjust c125 to include \'bound\' as per the example. So c125 becomes ""EGF_bound_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP"".\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c164"": ""EGFR_ErbB4_P"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c125"": ""EGF_bound_EGFR_ErbB4_ATP""\n}', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c6 + c16 => c10. The replacement table has three entries: c6 is ErbB1:ATP, c16 is EGF, and c10 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. The references for c10 include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. \n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with c6. The name is ErbB1:ATP. I know that ErbB1 is another name for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). So, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is a ligand or a molecule it binds. Since the guidelines suggest that if receptor and ligand can be identified, we connect them with an underscore. So, ErbB1 would be the receptor, and ATP the ligand. But wait, ErbB1:ATP might already be a specific term, so maybe it\'s better to keep it as is since it\'s a single word. Or perhaps we need to split it into receptor and ligand.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So ErbB1:ATP might be a specific term, so we can keep it as c6: ""ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nNext, c16 is EGF. EGF is a well-known ligand for EGFR. Since it\'s a single word and a standard abbreviation, we can keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nNow, c10 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which combines EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. From the references, it includes EGF, ATP, and EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1, so it\'s the same as ErbB1. So the complex here is EGF bound to ErbB1 along with ATP. Since the guidelines suggest including states like bound or active, perhaps we should represent this as a bound state.\n\nSo, considering the interaction, EGF binds to ErbB1 (EGFR), which then binds ATP. So the complex would be EGF bound to ErbB1, which is active. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"". But looking at the references, it includes EGF, ATP, and EGFR, which implies that the active form with ATP is part of the product. So perhaps the active state is important here.\n\nAlternatively, since the product is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which might indicate the receptor-ligand complex with ATP. So maybe it\'s the active form of the receptor with the ligand. So the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nc6: ""ErbB1_ATP"" (since it\'s ErbB1 with ATP)\nc16: ""EGF"" (as it\'s a ligand)\nc10: ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" (since it\'s the active complex with EGF and ErbB1, which is EGFR)\n\nI think that makes sense. So the JSON would map each id accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"", it could become ""IL6_R"" or something similar. But I need to check if the receptor or ligand names are in the ""name"" column. If not, I should use context or references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy. So I can\'t just stop at the `name`; I have to look into the references as well.\n\nAnother point is about states like ""bound"" or ""active."" If applicable, I should include those as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active."" But if the term is already clear as an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nThey also want me to prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column for consistency, even if the references have synonyms. So I should check both but give preference to the `name`.\n\nLooking at the input provided, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four rows with `id`, `name`, and `references`. Let me go through each `id` one by one.\n\nStarting with `bEGFR` in the reactants: the `name` is boundEGFR, and the references mention EGF and EGFR. So boundEGFR is already a descriptive name. It\'s an abbreviation, but since it\'s interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So the term for `bEGFR` would stay as ""boundEGFR.""\n\nNext is `PI3K` in reactants. The `name` is PI3K, and the references have a Miriam ID, but it\'s the same as another entry. Since PI3K is a well-known abbreviation for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and it\'s interpretable as-is, I can keep it as ""PI3K.""\n\nMoving to the products, we have another `bEGFR`, which is the same as the reactant. So it\'s also ""boundEGFR.""\n\nLastly, `pPI3K` in products. The `name` is pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K. The references include a Miriam ID for abao:0002007 and omit:0027264. Since pPI3K is an abbreviation that\'s reasonably clear, I don\'t need to change it. So it remains ""pPI3K.""\n\nI should make sure each `id` maps correctly without adding any extra words unless necessary. Since all the terms are already single words and don\'t require combining receptors or ligands, I can directly map them. Also, there\'s no need for states like ""active"" because the terms already indicate their state through the `name`.\n\nSo the final JSON should have each `id` as a key with its corresponding term. I\'ll structure it accordingly without any explanations, just the JSON object as requested.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have phrases; I need to condense things into one word, possibly using underscores. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include those as part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries, each with an id, name, and references. The roles are either reactants or products.\n\nFor the first entry, id is bEGFR, name is boundEGFR, and the references point to EGFR and EGF. According to the guidelines, if the name is already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So, I can map bEGFR to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nNext, PI3K\'s name is PI3K, and the references include some URNs, but the name is straightforward. Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"".\n\nThe third entry is also bEGFR, same as the first one. So, it maps to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nThe last id is pPI3K, name is pPI3K, references include some URNs. Again, the name is straightforward, so I\'ll map it to ""pPI3K"".\n\nI should also consider if any of these terms need to be split into receptor or ligand. For example, if there was an \'R\' or \'L\' suffix, I would connect them with an underscore. But in this case, the ids are already in a format that\'s biologically meaningful without needing that step.\n\nI don\'t see any need for a two-step process here since the names are directly interpretable. Also, none of the terms require adding states like ""bound"" or ""active"" beyond what\'s already in the name.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its corresponding name as they are, since they meet the criteria of being single words and are already biologically interpretable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: x1 + x2 => x3. The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1, the name is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should make it a single word. EGF is an acronym for Epidermal Growth Factor, but since it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So x1 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. It\'s a receptor, so I need to add ""_R"" to make it clear. So x2 becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, x3 is EGF-EGFR, which is a complex of the ligand and receptor. The name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references confirm both EGF and EGFR. To make it a single word, I\'ll combine them with an underscore, so it becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, should I include the state? The guidelines mention including states if applicable, but in this case, there\'s no state mentioned. So I think it\'s just the complex.\n\nI should also check if there are any ambiguous terms. EGF and EGFR are pretty standard, so no ambiguity here. The references support the terms, so I don\'t need to change anything else.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have x1 as ""EGF"", x2 as ""EGFR_R"", and x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The references for both are ""EGF; EGFR"". My task is to convert these into more interpretable terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, x3 is ""EGF-EGFR"". I think this refers to the ligand EGF bound to its receptor EGFR. Similarly, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimerized form, perhaps after binding.\n\nI need to consider the guidelines. Since ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor, I should map them as ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R"". But wait, the replacement table shows ""EGF-EGFR"" as a single term. Maybe it\'s a complex of the ligand and receptor.\n\nHmm, the user\'s example suggests that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the table, then refine it with references. So, for x3, the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references are EGF and EGFR. So, I should represent this as a complex where EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. Maybe combine them into ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. So, ""EGF"" is a ligand, ""EGFR"" is a receptor. So, maybe ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"". But that\'s two words, and the user wants a single word. Wait, the example shows ""IL6_R"" as a single word. So perhaps I can combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"" without the \'L\' and \'R\' because it\'s a complex.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines shows ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becoming ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the term is already a complex, perhaps I should just use the combined name as a single term. So, ""EGF-EGFR"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut looking at the references, both x3 and x4 have EGF and EGFR. So, x3 is the reactant, which is the unbound form, and x4 is the product, which is the bound or dimerized form. So, for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_active"" or ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include states like \'active\' or \'bound\' unless necessary. So, maybe x4 is the dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" or ""EGF_EGFR_2"".\n\nWait, in the replacement table, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, to represent this, I can add ""_dimer"" or just use ""_2"". But the guidelines say to include states with an underscore. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t add any state, just the combined term. So, perhaps for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"" as the reactant, and x4 is ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" as the product.\n\nAlternatively, since x4 is the product of the reaction x3 => x4, it\'s the bound form. So, maybe x4 should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the references for both x3 and x4 are the same, so maybe the only difference is the state. So, I think the correct approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed ""R"" and ""L"" being combined. So, perhaps I should map x3 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"" and x4 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_active"" or something similar. But that would be two words, and the user wants a single word. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to just combine them into a single term without the \'L\' and \'R\' since the complex is a single entity.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", I can use that as the term, replacing the hyphen with an underscore, making it ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSo, for x3, the term is ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, since it\'s the product, it\'s the same complex but in a different state. The replacement table shows it as ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, I can add ""_dimer"" to it, making it ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nAlternatively, since the user\'s example didn\'t add any state unless necessary, maybe I should just leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, but that doesn\'t capture the difference between x3 and x4.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not changed. So, if ""EGF-EGFR"" is a standard term, maybe I can leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for x3 and ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" for x4.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe the better approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" to indicate the active form after binding.\n\nI think I\'ll go with that. So, the JSON object would have x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is x6 + x16 => x10. The replacement table has three entries: x6 is EGFRi with a reference to EGFR, x16 is EGFi without a reference, and x10 is EGF-EGFRi with references to EGF and EGFR.\n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with x6. The name is EGFRi, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. The \'i\' in EGFRi might stand for \'inhibitor\'. So EGFRi would be an inhibitor of the EGFR receptor. I should represent this as a single word, so maybe \'EGFR_inhibitor\'.\n\nNext is x16. The name is EGFi, and there\'s no reference. EGFi could be similar to EGFRi, but without the R. So perhaps it\'s EGF inhibitor. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor. So this would be \'EGF_inhibitor\'.\n\nThen, x10. The name is EGF-EGFRi, with references to EGF and EGFR. This seems to be the complex formed when EGF binds to the EGFR inhibitor. So, perhaps this is the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. So it would be \'EGF_EGFRi_active\' or maybe \'EGF-EGFRi_bound\'?\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we can use an underscore. For example, R and L become something like IL6_R. So for x10, which is EGF-EGFRi, maybe we can represent this as EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor. But since EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps the term should reflect that. So maybe \'EGF_L\' for the ligand and \'EGFR_R\' for the receptor, but in this case, it\'s the inhibitor.\n\nWait, but x6 is EGFRi, which is the inhibitor of EGFR. So x6 is the EGFR inhibitor. x16 is EGFi, which might be the inhibitor of EGF. But that doesn\'t make much sense because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are typically for receptors. Maybe EGFi is a typo, and it\'s supposed to be EGF, but since it\'s EGFi, I\'ll proceed with that.\n\nSo for x10, the product, which is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the EGFR inhibitor. But in biological terms, when a ligand binds to a receptor, it\'s usually the ligand and receptor together. But in this case, the inhibitor is involved, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x10 is the product of x6 and x16 reacting, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. But I\'m not entirely sure. The references for x10 are EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the inhibitor.\n\nWait, the name is EGF-EGFRi, so it\'s EGF connected to EGFRi. So maybe it\'s the EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor, making it active. So the term could be \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we use an underscore. So perhaps x6 is the receptor (EGFR_R) and x16 is the ligand (EGF_L). But in this case, x6 is EGFRi, which is an inhibitor, not the receptor itself. So maybe I need to represent it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent x6 as \'EGFR_inhibitor\' and x16 as \'EGF_inhibitor\', but that seems a bit off because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are usually for receptors. So maybe x16 is actually EGF, but it\'s written as EGFi, perhaps a typo. But I have to go with what\'s given.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- x6: EGFRi → \'EGFR_inhibitor\'\n- x16: EGFi → \'EGF_inhibitor\' (though this is less common)\n- x10: EGF-EGFRi → \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'\n\nBut considering the references, x10 is linked to EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the active form when EGF is bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the inhibitor bound to EGF, making it active.\n\nI think I\'ll go with \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' for x10, but I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it\'s just \'EGF_EGFRi\' as a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. So EGFRi could be left as \'EGFRi\', but the name is EGFRi, so maybe it\'s better to represent it as \'EGFR_inhibitor\' for clarity.\n\nSimilarly, EGFi would be \'EGF_inhibitor\', but that\'s not a common term. Maybe it\'s a typo for EGF. But I\'ll proceed with \'EGF_inhibitor\' as per the name.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x6"": ""EGFR_inhibitor"",\n  ""x16"": ""EGF_inhibitor"",\n  ""x10"": ""EGF_EGFRi_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about x16. Maybe it\'s supposed to be EGF, not EGFi. But according to the replacement table, it\'s EGFi, so I\'ll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x16 is the ligand, so \'EGF_L\', but the name is EGFi, which is an inhibitor. So I think the initial approach is correct.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: R + EGF => Ra. Then there\'s a replacement table with four columns: role, id, name, and references. The table has three entries for reactants and one for products.\n\nThe first thing I notice is the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON should be a single word. So I need to make sure each id is mapped to a term that\'s concise. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For R, the name is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. So R stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Since it\'s a receptor, I should connect it with an underscore. So R becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n  \n- EGF\'s name is Epidermal_Growth_Factor, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I need to append ""_L"" to it. So EGF becomes ""EGF_L"".\n\n- Ra\'s name is EGF_EGFR, and the references are EGFR and EGF. This is a product, so it\'s the bound form of the receptor and ligand. I should combine them with an underscore and add ""_bound"" to indicate the state. So Ra becomes ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nI should also check if any two-step process is needed. For example, mapping from id to name first and then refining. In this case, R maps directly to EGFR, which is a receptor, so no further refinement is needed beyond adding ""_R"". Similarly, EGF maps directly to its name, so adding ""_L"" suffices.\n\nI need to ensure that I\'m not making unnecessary changes if the term is already interpretable. For example, if an id is ""IL6"", I wouldn\'t change it unless there\'s a more specific term in the references.\n\nAlso, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the \'name\' column if there are synonyms. In this case, all the names are pretty straightforward, so that\'s fine.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the cases. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is the id and the value is the corresponding term with the appropriate suffixes.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given includes an equation: E1 => E_E1; E. Then there\'s a replacement table with three rows. Let me parse this table carefully.\n\nThe first row is for reactants: id is E1, name is ErbB1, and references include EGFR. So, E1 should map to ErbB1. Since ErbB1 is a known receptor (EGFR is another name for it), maybe I should consider if it\'s a receptor or ligand. In this case, ErbB1 is a receptor, so perhaps it\'s EGF\'s receptor. But the name column says ErbB1, so I should stick to that unless the references suggest a different term. Since the name is specific, I don\'t need to change it.\n\nNext, the second row is for products: id is E_E1, name is EGF-ErbB1, references are EGFR and EGF. So, this is a complex of EGF and ErbB1. According to the guidelines, if it\'s a ligand-receptor pair, I should combine them with an underscore. The ligand here is EGF, and the receptor is ErbB1. So, the combined term would be EGF_ErbB1.\n\nThe third row is for modifiers: id is E, name is EGF, references are EGF. So, this is straightforward. E maps to EGF, which is a ligand.\n\nNow, I need to make sure each term is a single word. For E1, it\'s ErbB1, which is fine. For E_E1, combining EGF and ErbB1 gives EGF_ErbB1, which is a single term with an underscore. E is EGF, which is already a single word.\n\nI should also consider if any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" are needed, but in this case, the terms don\'t specify such states, so I can skip that.\n\nFinally, I need to structure the JSON object with each id as the key and the corresponding term as the value. So, the output should be:\n\n{\n  ""E1"": ""ErbB1"",\n  ""E_E1"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""E"": ""EGF""\n}\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines and the input provided. I\'ll make sure to only include the JSON object without any additional explanations as per the user\'s request.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object mapping each id in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, R becomes IL6_R. I need to make sure I\'m using the right context and references for accurate substitutions. Sometimes it\'s a two-step process: first map id to name, then refine with references.\n\nThe input includes an equation: mIRS => mIRSp; Rp, IRp. The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with mIRS. The name is empty, and references are empty. Since it\'s an abbreviation, I should leave it as is. So mIRS maps to ""mIRS"".\n\nNext, mIRSp. Similarly, name and references are empty. It\'s an abbreviation, so it stays ""mIRSp"".\n\nNow, Rp. The name is empty, but references are EGF and EGFR. Wait, EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So Rp is likely the receptor. Therefore, Rp should be ""EGFR_R"".\n\nThen, IRp. The name is empty, and references are empty. So IRp is an abbreviation and stays ""IRp"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to these terms. I\'ll make sure each key is the id and the value is the term, all in lowercase as per the example. So the final JSON is {""mirs"": ""mIRS"", ""mirsp"": ""mIRSp"", ""rp"": ""EGFR_R"", ""irp"": ""IRp""}.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given is an equation: R + EGF => RE. Along with that, there\'s a replacement table. Let me examine the table:\n\n- Role: reactants, id: R, name: (empty), references: (empty)\n- Role: reactants, id: EGF, name: EGF, references: EGF\n- Role: products, id: RE, name: (empty), references: EGFR; EGF\n\nHmm, so for R, the name is empty, and references are also empty. EGF has name EGF and references EGF. RE has an empty name but references EGFR and EGF.\n\nThe equation suggests that R and EGF combine to form RE. In biology, EGF typically stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, R is likely the receptor for EGF, which would be EGFR. So, R is EGFR, and when it binds to EGF, the product is the receptor-ligand complex, which would be EGFR_EGF.\n\nBut wait, the replacement table for RE has references EGFR and EGF, so the product is the combination of both. Therefore, the id RE should map to EGFR_EGF.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- R: Since it\'s the receptor for EGF, it\'s EGFR.\n- EGF: It\'s already a standard term, so it stays EGF.\n- RE: The product is the receptor and ligand together, so EGFR_EGF.\n\nI need to ensure each is a single word, so EGFR_EGF works as it\'s one term connected by an underscore.\n\nI should also check if any states like ""active"" or ""bound"" are needed, but the references don\'t mention that, so I\'ll stick with the base terms.\n\nFinally, I\'ll structure this into a JSON object with the ids as keys and the terms as values.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is x6 + x16 => x10. The replacement table has three entries: x6 is EGFRi with a reference to EGFR, x16 is EGFi without a reference, and x10 is EGF-EGFRi with references to EGF and EGFR.\n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with x6. The name is EGFRi, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. The \'i\' in EGFRi might stand for \'inhibitor\'. So EGFRi would be an inhibitor of the EGFR receptor. I should represent this as a single word, so maybe \'EGFR_inhibitor\'.\n\nNext is x16. The name is EGFi, and there\'s no reference. EGFi could be similar to EGFRi, but without the R. So perhaps it\'s EGF inhibitor. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor. So this would be \'EGF_inhibitor\'.\n\nThen, x10. The name is EGF-EGFRi, with references to EGF and EGFR. This seems to be the complex formed when EGF binds to the EGFR inhibitor. So, perhaps this is the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. So it would be \'EGF_EGFRi_active\' or maybe \'EGF-EGFRi_bound\'?\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we can use an underscore. For example, R and L become something like IL6_R. So for x10, which is EGF-EGFRi, maybe we can represent this as EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor. But since EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps the term should reflect that. So maybe \'EGF_L\' for the ligand and \'EGFR_R\' for the receptor, but in this case, it\'s the inhibitor.\n\nWait, but x6 is EGFRi, which is the inhibitor of EGFR. So x6 is the EGFR inhibitor. x16 is EGFi, which might be the inhibitor of EGF. But that doesn\'t make much sense because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are typically for receptors. Maybe EGFi is a typo, and it\'s supposed to be EGF, but since it\'s EGFi, I\'ll proceed with that.\n\nSo for x10, the product, which is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the EGFR inhibitor. But in biological terms, when a ligand binds to a receptor, it\'s usually the ligand and receptor together. But in this case, the inhibitor is involved, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x10 is the product of x6 and x16 reacting, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. But I\'m not entirely sure. The references for x10 are EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the inhibitor.\n\nWait, the name is EGF-EGFRi, so it\'s EGF connected to EGFRi. So maybe it\'s the EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor, making it active. So the term could be \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we use an underscore. So perhaps x6 is the receptor (EGFR_R) and x16 is the ligand (EGF_L). But in this case, x6 is EGFRi, which is an inhibitor, not the receptor itself. So maybe I need to represent it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent x6 as \'EGFR_inhibitor\' and x16 as \'EGF_inhibitor\', but that seems a bit off because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are usually for receptors. So maybe x16 is actually EGF, but it\'s written as EGFi, perhaps a typo. But I have to go with what\'s given.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- x6: EGFRi → \'EGFR_inhibitor\'\n- x16: EGFi → \'EGF_inhibitor\' (though this is less common)\n- x10: EGF-EGFRi → \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'\n\nBut considering the references, x10 is linked to EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the active form when EGF is bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the inhibitor bound to EGF, making it active.\n\nI think I\'ll go with \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' for x10, as it\'s the product of x6 and x16 reacting, which are the inhibitors. So when they combine, they form a bound complex, which is active.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x6"": ""EGFR_inhibitor"",\n  ""x16"": ""EGF_inhibitor"",\n  ""x10"": ""EGF_EGFRi_bound""\n}\n\nWait, but EGFi as an inhibitor of EGF doesn\'t make much sense. Maybe x16 is just EGF. But the name is EGFi, so perhaps it\'s a typo, but I have to use what\'s given. Alternatively, maybe x16 is the receptor, but that doesn\'t fit with the name EGFi.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x16 is the ligand EGF, but written as EGFi. Maybe it\'s a typo, and I should correct it to EGF. But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. So I\'ll proceed with EGFi as is.\n\nSo, final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""x6"": ""EGFR_inhibitor"",\n  ""x16"": ""EGF_inhibitor"",\n  ""x10"": ""EGF_EGFRi_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure about x16 being an inhibitor. Maybe it\'s better to represent x16 as \'EGF\' if it\'s the ligand, but since the name is EGFi, perhaps it\'s the inhibitor. Alternatively, maybe x16 is the active form of EGF, but that\'s not common.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x16 is the receptor, but that doesn\'t make sense because EGFi would imply inhibitor. Hmm.\n\nWait, maybe the replacement table is using \'i\' for inhibitor, so x6 is EGFR inhibitor, x16 is EGF inhibitor, and x10 is the complex of EGF and EGFR inhibitor. But that seems a bit forced.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x10 is the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF, which is why it\'s called EGF-EGFRi. So, the term would be \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'.\n\nI think I\'ll go with that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: the equation is c1 + c2 => c3, and the replacement table has three entries.\n\nFor c1, the id is \'c1\', the name is \'EGF\', and the reference is \'EGF\'. EGF is a known ligand, so I should represent it as a single word. Since it\'s a ligand, maybe it should be \'EGF_L\'. But the guidelines say if it\'s simple, don\'t change it. So perhaps just \'EGF\' is okay, but since it\'s a ligand, maybe the \'L\' suffix is better. I\'ll go with \'EGF_L\'.\n\nNext, c2 is \'ErbB1:ATP\' with references \'ATP; EGFR\'. ErbB1 is the same as EGFR, the epidermal growth factor receptor. So this is the receptor part. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe I should represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s more than a single word. Wait, the guidelines say each term should be a single word, so I need to combine them. So maybe \'EGFR_R_ATP\' or \'EGFR_ATP_R\'. Hmm, but the main thing is to indicate it\'s the receptor and bound to ATP. So I\'ll make it \'EGFR_R_ATP\'.\n\nFor c3, the product is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\' with references \'EGF; ATP; EGFR\'. This is the complex of EGF, EGFR, and ATP. Since it\'s a product, it\'s the bound state. So I should represent it as a single term. It\'s the EGF ligand bound to the EGFR receptor with ATP. So maybe \'EGF_EGFR_R_ATP_bound\' but that\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency. So for c3, the name is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\', which is a complex. So maybe I should combine them as \'EGF_EGFR_R_ATP\' but ensure it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since it\'s the product, it\'s in a bound state, so maybe \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' is better.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to include states like \'bound\' or \'active\' with an underscore. So for c3, it\'s the product, which is the bound form. So perhaps the term should be \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- c1: EGF_L\n- c2: EGFR_R_ATP\n- c3: EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\n\nBut wait, I\'m not sure if \'EGFR_R_ATP\' is the best term for c2. Since c2 is ErbB1:ATP, which is the receptor bound to ATP, maybe it\'s better to represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but as a single word. However, the guidelines say each term must be a single word, so I can\'t have spaces. So perhaps \'EGFR_R_boundATP\' but that\'s not standard. Alternatively, just \'EGFR_R_ATP\' as separate parts but as a single term.\n\nI think the best approach is to represent each component clearly. For c2, since it\'s the receptor bound to ATP, \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' would be the full term, but as a single word, it\'s \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' without spaces. But I\'m not sure if that\'s acceptable. Alternatively, maybe just \'EGFR_ATP\' as the term, but that might be ambiguous.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps for c2, since it\'s a receptor, we can represent it as \'EGFR_R\' and for the bound ATP, include it as part of the term. So maybe \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. However, the guidelines allow for including states with underscores, so that should be fine.\n\nWait, the example given was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"". So in that case, the receptor is identified by \'R\' and ligand by \'L\'. So for c2, which is ErbB1:ATP, which is the receptor bound to ATP, maybe we can represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' as a single term, using underscores to separate parts.\n\nSimilarly, for c3, which is the product of EGF, EGFR, and ATP, it\'s the bound state. So combining all parts with underscores, it would be \'EGF_EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but as a single term.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example shows that when you have a receptor, you add \'_R\' and for ligand \'_L\'. So for c1, which is EGF, a ligand, it\'s \'EGF_L\'. For c2, which is the receptor (ErbB1/EGFR) bound to ATP, it\'s \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\'. And for c3, the product, which is the complex, it\'s \'EGF_EGFR_R_bound_ATP\'.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the product should be a separate term or just the combination. The product is the result of the reaction, so it\'s the bound form of EGF, EGFR, and ATP. So perhaps the term should reflect that it\'s the bound state, so \'EGF_EGFR_ATP_bound\' as a single term.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \'EGF_EGFR_bound_ATP\' but I think including \'bound\' as part of the term is more accurate.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to these terms.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, maybe I should combine them into a single term. The format is ligand_receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. But wait, the guidelines mention if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So I think it\'s EGF as ligand and ErbB1 as receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I think it\'s part of the term. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ATP. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so maybe it\'s a ternary complex, but in terms of mapping, I need to make it a single word. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to stick with EGF_ErbB1 since ATP is a part of the reaction but not the term itself. Or perhaps I need to include it. The guidelines say to use the name column if possible. So I\'ll go with EGF_ErbB1.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, but the references include EGFR. So maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1 since ErbB1 is the receptor.\n\nNext, c503 has the name ""ErbB4:Inh"". So ErbB4 is a receptor, and Inh is an inhibitor. So perhaps it\'s ErbB4_Inh. That makes sense.\n\nThen, c505 has the name ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"". The parentheses suggest a complex, and _P might indicate phosphorylated. So maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P. The references include EGF and EGFR, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1 is part of it, but the name includes ErbB3 as well. So combining all, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P. Since the product also includes Inh, perhaps it\'s part of the term as well, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh. But I need to make it a single word, so I\'ll join with underscores: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh. But wait, the guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map from id to name, then refine. So the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"". So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh, but as a single word, I think I should combine them into EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nWait, but in the equation, c3 is EGF_ErbB1, and c503 is ErbB4_Inh. The product is a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, phosphorylated, and Inh. So perhaps the product term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- c3: EGF_ErbB1\n- c503: ErbB4_Inh\n- c505: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh\n\nBut wait, the name for c505 is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"". So maybe it\'s better to represent it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh, but as a single word, perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh. Alternatively, maybe the ""Inh"" is separate, but the guidelines say to include it as part of the term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with the Inh as part of the product, but I think it\'s better to include it in the term since it\'s part of the name.\n\nWait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. Let\'s look at the example given in the guidelines. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So the id is mapped to a term that includes the ligand and receptor. So for c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ATP, but since the guidelines say to use the name column, maybe it\'s better to use EGF_ErbB1.\n\nSimilarly, c503 is ErbB4:Inh, so ErbB4_Inh.\n\nc505 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh, but as a single word, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a phosphorylated form, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh is another term. But the name includes Inh as part of the product, so it\'s part of the same term.\n\nI think I\'ll go with:\n\nc3: EGF_ErbB1\n\nc503: ErbB4_Inh\n\nc505: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh → but as a single word, it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nWait, but in the equation, c505 is the product, so it\'s the result of c3 + c503. So c3 is EGF_ErbB1, c503 is ErbB4_Inh, and c505 is the product, which includes EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, phosphorylated, and Inh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, which is phosphorylated, and also includes the inhibitor.

So maybe it\'s better to represent EGF_ErbB1 as EGF_EGFR, but the guidelines say to prioritize the name column. So I\'ll stick with EGF_ErbB1.\n\nAnother thought: the product name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"", so perhaps it\'s a complex where EGF is bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, which is phosphorylated, and also has an inhibitor. So the term could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh, but as a single term, perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh becomes EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh is a separate term, but since it\'s part of the name, I think it\'s better to include it as part of the term.\n\nSo the final JSON is:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c503"": ""ErbB4_Inh"",\n  ""c505"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh""\n}\n\nI think that\'s a reasonable mapping based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I\'m not sure if I should include it. The guidelines say to use context, so maybe just EGF_ErbB1.\n\n- For c506, the name is ""ErbB3:Inh"" and no references. Since it\'s a reactant, and the name has Inh, which probably stands for inhibitor. So maybe it\'s an inhibitor of ErbB3. But how to represent this? The guidelines say to include states like bound or active, but Inh isn\'t exactly a state. Alternatively, it could be ErbB3 bound by an inhibitor. Maybe ErbB3_Inh.\n\n- For c507, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"" and references EGF, EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. The _P might indicate phosphorylation. So the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, phosphorylated. Then there\'s :Inh, which might be an inhibitor. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and maybe with Inh? Or perhaps it\'s part of the product, so maybe the complex is active, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_active. But the name also has :Inh, so maybe the product includes the inhibitor. Alternatively, the product is the complex with the inhibitor, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. So for c3, name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. References include EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So maybe EGF_ErbB1.\n\nFor c506, name is ErbB3:Inh, no references. So perhaps it\'s ErbB3 inhibited, so ErbB3_inhibited or ErbB3_Inh.\n\nFor c507, name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh. So the complex is EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB3, phosphorylated, and with an inhibitor. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh. But how to format that. Guidelines say to use underscores for states. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inhibitor is a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product, it\'s part of the term. So the JSON would map each id to their respective terms.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nc3: EGF_ErbB1\n\nc506: ErbB3_Inh\n\nc507: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P\n\nWait, but the name for c507 has Inh, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if Inh is a state or a separate entity. Since it\'s part of the product, maybe it\'s part of the complex. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe the Inh is just part of the product term, so include it as is. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but c507\'s name includes :Inh, so perhaps it\'s part of the product term. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh. But how to represent that. Maybe as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, since the references for c507 include EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1, so maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P, and the Inh is a separate part, but since it\'s part of the product, perhaps it\'s included as a state. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a suffix.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if Inh is a state or a separate entity. If it\'s a state, then maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh. If it\'s a separate entity, maybe it\'s part of the complex. But in the JSON, each id maps to a single term, so perhaps c507 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P.\n\nWait, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh. So the complex is phosphorylated and has an inhibitor. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with the inhibitor. But how to format that. Maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, the Inh might be a separate part, but in the JSON, each id is mapped individually. So c507 is the product, which includes the complex and the inhibitor. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh, but since it\'s a single term, maybe combine them as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but c507\'s name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the Inh is a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product, it\'s part of the term. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s the correct approach. Maybe I should focus on the name and references. For c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, but the references include EGFR, which is ErbB1. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1. For c506, it\'s ErbB3:Inh, so maybe ErbB3_Inh. For c507, it\'s (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P, and the Inh might be part of the product, but perhaps it\'s a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product term, maybe it\'s included as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Inh is an inhibitor of the complex, so the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but the name for c507 includes Inh, so maybe I should include it. So perhaps c507 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe it\'s better to include it as part of the term. So the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best approach based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c159 + c105 => c123. Each of these ids (c159, c105, c123) is listed in the replacement table with their names and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2) and references are EGF; EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since the guidelines suggest using receptor and ligand names, perhaps I should combine them. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""? But wait, the example given in the guidelines uses an underscore, like IL6_R or CSF1R_L. Hmm, but in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_ligand with receptors. But the example shows R and L as suffixes, so maybe EGF as L and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as R. Wait, but the name is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps the term should represent the complex. Since it\'s a complex, maybe just using the components. But the guidelines say to use single words. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" is acceptable.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP with a value 1.2e9, but the references are empty. So it\'s just ATP, which is a molecule. Since it\'s a standard term, we can leave it as ATP.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and references are EGF; EGFR. So this is the product after ATP binds to the complex. So perhaps it\'s the ATP-bound form. The guidelines suggest including states like bound or active. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound""? But the name already includes ATP, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as the complex with ATP. Alternatively, since ATP is a ligand, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP. But the guidelines say if it\'s a ligand, use an underscore, so perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, the example was R and L as suffixes. But in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So maybe c159 should be EGF (ligand) and the receptors as ErbB1 and ErbB2. But the name is a complex, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as EGF bound to the receptors. But the term needs to be a single word. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" for c159, ""ATP"" for c105, and ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" for c123.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output was ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps for c159, since it\'s the ligand and receptors, it\'s EGF (ligand) and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as receptors. But how to represent that in a single word? Maybe ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB2_R""? But that\'s a bit long and might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" as a complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the complex is the receptor dimer, so ErbB1 and ErbB2 form a heterodimer bound to EGF. So the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_receptor_complex"" but that\'s more than a single word. Hmm, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. So perhaps we can combine them with underscores without the word \'receptor\' or \'ligand\' unless necessary.\n\nWait, in the example, the output for c159 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" and for c123 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"". So perhaps that\'s the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n{\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c123"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about c123. Should it be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound_ATP"" or just include ATP as part of the complex? The guidelines mention including states like bound, so maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" would be better. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, so it\'s the complex with ATP. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" to indicate the state. But the guidelines say to use the name column as priority, so since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, maybe it\'s better to include ATP as part of the term without adding \'bound\' unless necessary.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct. So the JSON would be as above.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c160 + c105 => c124. There's a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c160, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3) and references are EGF; EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. Since it's a ligand bound to two receptors, I should represent this as a complex. The guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore, but here it's more of a complex. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The references column is empty, so I don't have synonyms. Since ATP is a common term, I'll just use ATP.\n\nFor c124, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP, references are EGF; EGFR. This seems similar to c160 but includes ATP. So it's the same complex as before but with ATP bound. According to guidelines, I can include states like 'bound' or 'active' with underscores. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word. For c160 and c124, the names are already multi-word but represent complexes, so using underscores makes sense. ATP is fine as is.\n\nChecking the guidelines again: if the name is an abbreviation, leave it. Since EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3 are abbreviations, it's acceptable to use them. Also, including 'bound' for the ATP makes the term more interpretable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map c160 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3, c105 to ATP, and c124 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP."", 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: x1 + x2 => x3. The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a ligand, I can denote it as EGF_L. That makes sense because ligands bind to receptors.\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR is a receptor, so I\'ll name it EGFR_R. That\'s straightforward.\n\nNow, x3 is a bit trickier. The name is EGF-EGFR, and the references are both EGF and EGFR. According to the guidelines, if the term is a combination, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. But since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, combining them as EGF-EGFR might already imply the complex. However, looking at the guidelines, I should consider the state. Since x3 is a product, it\'s likely the bound state of the receptor-ligand complex. So, I should denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nWait, let me think again. The guidelines say if it\'s a combination, use the name from the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, but the references are both EGF and EGFR. So maybe I should prioritize the name but also consider the biological state. Since it\'s a product, it\'s probably the bound form. So combining them with an underscore and adding the state makes sense. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example had ""IL6_R_active"". So the structure is ligand_receptor_state. Hmm, but in the case of x3, the product is the complex. So maybe it\'s better to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound or EGF_EGFR_bound. I think the correct way is to list the receptor first, followed by the ligand, then the state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because in the guidelines, they said to use the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, which is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nWait, no. The guidelines say that if the term can be a single word, just use it. But since EGF-EGFR is a complex, and it\'s the product, it\'s in the bound state. So I should represent it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me check the example they provided. In the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So for a complex, maybe it\'s better to use receptor first, then ligand, then state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut the name is EGF-EGFR, which is the same as EGF bound to EGFR. So perhaps EGF_EGFR_bound is more accurate.\n\nI think I should go with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nWait, but the references for x3 are EGF and EGFR. So the complex is EGF bound to EGFR. So in the JSON, x3 should be EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x1"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""x2"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""x3"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit uncertain about the ordering. Should it be EGF_EGFR or EGFR_EGF? The example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe the receptor comes first. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nHmm, I think the correct approach is to use the order from the name column. Since the name is EGF-EGFR, I\'ll use that as the base and add the state. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, since EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps it\'s more accurate to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound to show the receptor first.\n\nI\'m a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up how such complexes are typically denoted. Usually, it\'s ligand-receptor, but sometimes receptor-ligand. For example, IL6 binds to IL6R, so the complex might be IL6_IL6R_bound.\n\nIn the example, the user had ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps for the complex, it\'s ligand followed by receptor, then state.\n\nSo I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nSo the final JSON is:\n\n{\n  ""x1"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""x2"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""x3"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nI think that makes sense.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: E11 => E11P; SigT. So there are three ids here: E11, E11P, and SigT. I need to map each of these to their corresponding terms.\n\nLet me check the replacement table provided. \n\nStarting with E11:\n- The role is reactants, id is E11, name is (EGF-ErbB1)2, and references include EGFR and EGF. I remember that EGFR is the epidermal growth factor receptor, and EGF is the ligand. The name (EGF-ErbB1)2 suggests a dimer of EGF bound to ErbB1 (which is another name for EGFR). Since the guideline says if receptor and ligand can be identified, combine them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor. The term could be EGF_ErbB1. Also, since it\'s a dimer, maybe we need to include that. The name has a 2 in parentheses, so perhaps it\'s a dimer. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_dimer. Alternatively, since the product is E11P, which is E11_p, perhaps that refers to a phosphorylated form. But for E11 itself, I think EGF_ErbB1 is sufficient.\n\nNext, E11P:\n- Role is products, id is E11P, name is E11_p, reference is EGFR. The p likely stands for phosphorylated. So the term should be EGF_ErbB1_p. Alternatively, since E11 is EGF_ErbB1, the phosphorylated form would be EGF_ErbB1_p.\n\nThen, SigT:\n- Role is modifiers, id is SigT, name is Sig-PTP-1B. References are empty. The name is Sig-PTP-1B, which is an enzyme. The guideline says if it\'s a single word, we can leave it as is. Alternatively, since it\'s a receptor or ligand? Wait, PTP-1B is a phosphatase, so maybe not. But the name is Sig-PTP-1B, which is a single term. Alternatively, split it into parts: Sig and PTP-1B. But the guideline says if a single word can be formed, use an underscore. So perhaps Sig_PTP1B. Or keep it as Sig-PTP-1B. But the guideline suggests using underscores, so maybe Sig_PTP1B. However, in the replacement table, the name is Sig-PTP-1B, which is a single term, so maybe we can leave it as is or adjust to use underscores. Alternatively, since it\'s a known term, perhaps it\'s better to write it as Sig_PTP1B.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines: ""If the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, it is not recommended to make significant changes."" So Sig-PTP-1B is a known term, so maybe we can leave it as is, or adjust to Sig_PTP1B for consistency. The guideline also says to use context and references. Since the references are empty, perhaps we should stick with the name as is, but use underscores if possible. So Sig_PTP1B.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nE11: EGF_ErbB1\nE11P: EGF_ErbB1_p\nSigT: Sig_PTP1B\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, E11\'s name is (EGF-ErbB1)2. Does that mean a dimer? So maybe we should include \'dimer\' in the term. So EGF_ErbB1_dimer. Similarly, E11P would be EGF_ErbB1_dimer_p. But the name in E11P is E11_p, so maybe just the phosphorylated form. Alternatively, the product is the phosphorylated form of E11, which is the dimer. So perhaps E11P is the phosphorylated dimer. So EGF_ErbB1_dimer_p. But that might be too long. The guidelines say each term should be a single word, but in the example, they used IL6_R and IL6_R_active. So maybe we can include \'dimer\' as part of the term, like EGF_ErbB1_dimer. Then E11P would be EGF_ErbB1_dimer_p.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps E11 is the receptor-ligand complex, and E11P is the phosphorylated version. So E11 would be EGF_ErbB1, and E11P would be EGF_ErbB1_p.\n\nBut considering the name is (EGF-ErbB1)2, which indicates a dimer, so it\'s a dimer of EGF-ErbB1 complexes. So perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1_dimer. Then E11P would be EGF_ErbB1_dimer_p.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s necessary. The guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name for E11 is (EGF-ErbB1)2, but the references include EGFR and EGF. So perhaps the main term is EGF_ErbB1, and the dimer is implied by the context. So maybe E11 maps to EGF_ErbB1, and E11P maps to EGF_ErbB1_p.\n\nAs for SigT, the name is Sig-PTP-1B. The guideline suggests using underscores, so Sig_PTP1B.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""E11"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""E11P"": ""EGF_ErbB1_p"",\n  ""SigT"": ""Sig_PTP1B""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the most accurate based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: Rp + PI3K => Rp_PI3K. The replacement table has three rows. The first two are reactants, Rp and PI3K, and the product is Rp_PI3K.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, Rp\'s name is blank, but the references mention EGF and EGFR. So, Rp must be referring to the receptor. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, Rp should map to EGFR. So, Rp becomes ""EGFR"".\n\nPI3K\'s name is empty, but it\'s a known enzyme in biology, so I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"" since it\'s a standard abbreviation and doesn\'t need further interpretation.\n\nThe product is Rp_PI3K, which, after replacing Rp with EGFR, becomes ""EGFR_PI3K"". Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a complex, so the underscore makes sense here.\n\nI need to make sure I don\'t add any extra information beyond the JSON. Each key is the \'id\', and the value is the term. So, the JSON should look like:\n\n{\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""Rp_PI3K"": ""EGFR_PI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check to make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to use the \'name\' column if possible, but since Rp\'s name is blank, I used the reference. PI3K is straightforward. The product combines both. Yep, that should do it.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, the input includes an equation: mGABp_SHP2 => mGABp_pSHP2; Rp, aSrc. Then there\'s a replacement table with four entries. Each entry has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term in the JSON should be a single word. If the term is a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. The first entry has role ""reactants"" and id ""mGABp_SHP2"". The name and references are empty. So, I need to interpret this. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s a form of SHP2. The id has ""SHP2"" at the end, so perhaps it\'s SHP2 in some form. The product is ""mGABp_pSHP2"", which might mean SHP2 is phosphorylated. So, maybe ""mGABp_SHP2"" is the unphosphorylated form. But since the name is empty, I might have to just use the id as is, or find a better term.\n\n2. The second entry is ""mGABp_pSHP2"" as a product. Again, the name is empty. But the id suggests it\'s SHP2 phosphorylated, so maybe ""pSHP2"".\n\n3. The third entry is ""Rp"" with references EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is its receptor. So, Rp probably stands for EGF receptor. But since the id is ""Rp"", and the references mention both EGF and EGFR, I think Rp is the receptor. So, I should map ""Rp"" to ""EGFR"".\n\n4. The fourth entry is ""aSrc"". The references are empty. Src is a tyrosine kinase, often activated. The ""a"" might stand for active. So, ""aSrc"" could be ""active_Src"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to use the name column if possible, but here the name is empty. So I have to rely on the references or common abbreviations.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- ""mGABp_SHP2"" is a reactant, perhaps the unphosphorylated form, so maybe ""SHP2"".\n- ""mGABp_pSHP2"" is the product, so ""pSHP2"".\n- ""Rp"" maps to ""EGFR"" because the references are EGF and EGFR, and Rp is likely the receptor.\n- ""aSrc"" would be ""active_Src"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if it\'s a single word, keep it as is, but if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect with an underscore. But ""aSrc"" is an abbreviation, so maybe ""active_Src"" is better.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""mGABp_SHP2"": ""SHP2"",\n  ""mGABp_pSHP2"": ""pSHP2"",\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""aSrc"": ""active_Src""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the information provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""x4"" maps to ""EGF-EGFR_bound"" and ""x5"" maps to ""EGF-EGFR_active"". So, I need to see how they arrived at that.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for \'x4\', the name is ""EGF-EGFR^2"" and references are EGF and EGFR. The equation is x4 => x5, which implies a reaction from reactants to products. So, I think the \'^2\' in the name might indicate a state change, perhaps from bound to active.\n\nWait, in the example, they mapped \'x4\' to ""EGF-EGFR_bound"" and \'x5\' to ""EGF-EGFR_active"". That makes sense because the reaction is moving from a bound state to an active state.\n\nSo, I should follow the same logic. For each id, I\'ll look at the name and references. Since the name for \'x4\' is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", the \'^2\' probably denotes a bound state. So, the term becomes ""EGF-EGFR_bound"". For \'x5\', the name is ""EGF-EGFR*^2"", which might indicate an active state, so ""EGF-EGFR_active"".\n\nI should also ensure that each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, combining them makes sense. The states \'bound\' and \'active\' are added as per the example.\n\nI think that\'s it. So, the JSON would have \'x4\' mapped to ""EGF-EGFR_bound"" and \'x5\' to ""EGF-EGFR_active"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the input includes an equation: L_EGFR => L_EGFR_dimer. There\'s also a replacement table with two rows. Both have the same references: EGF; EGFR. The first row has id L_EGFR with no name, and the second has id L_EGFR_dimer also with no name.\n\nThe guidelines say each term in the JSON must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, the ids are L_EGFR and L_EGFR_dimer.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, both ids have references to EGF and EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand, I think L refers to the ligand. So L_EGFR would be EGF, and L_EGFR_dimer would be the dimer form of EGF.\n\nWait, but the id is L_EGFR, so maybe it\'s the ligand for EGFR, which is EGF. So the term should be EGF_L. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So L would be the ligand, so EGF_L. Similarly, the dimer would be EGF_L_dimer.\n\nBut the equation shows L_EGFR converting to L_EGFR_dimer, so in the JSON, each id needs to map to a term. So for L_EGFR, the term is EGF_L, and for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s EGF_L_dimer.\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word, so combining with underscores is okay. Also, I should prioritize the \'name\' column if available, but here it\'s empty, so I rely on the references.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map L_EGFR to ""EGF_L"" and L_EGFR_dimer to ""EGF_L_dimer"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. The user wants each term to be a single word. If there\'s an ambiguous term, I need to replace it with something more specific using the replacement table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column over \'references\' for consistency. Finally, the output should be a JSON object without any extra comments.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x8 => x87. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n1. reactants: x8 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" with references EGFR and EGF.\n2. products: x87 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" with no references.\n\nI need to process each id (x8 and x87) and map them to the correct terms.\n\nStarting with x8:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"". The references are EGFR and EGF. I know that EGFR is the receptor and EGF is the ligand. The \'i\' likely stands for \'inhibitor\', and the \'*^2\' might be a subscript indicating a dimer or something similar. Since the name isn\'t a single word, I need to make it one. Combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore makes sense. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor. The ""i*^2"" part could refer to an inhibited dimer. Maybe I can represent this as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is too long. Alternatively, maybe it\'s better to simplify. Since ""EGF-EGFRi"" might mean EGF bound to an inhibited EGFR, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". But the ""*^2"" might indicate a dimer, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". Hmm, but the user wants a single word, so I need to combine them without spaces. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so it\'s about state. So maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" is better, and the ""*^2"" could be ""dimer"" but that\'s another state. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the format as per the name, so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". The ""*^2"" might be a superscript indicating a dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable, but I\'m not sure if it\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_i"" with the understanding that \'i\' stands for inhibited. But the user\'s guidelines say to avoid making significant changes if the term is already interpretable. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", which might be a shorthand. So maybe the best approach is to convert ""EGF-EGFRi"" into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and the ""*^2"" as ""dimer"", so combining them as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But that\'s a bit long, but it\'s a single word.\n\nNow for x87:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"". The \'deg\' likely stands for \'degradation\' or \'degenerate\', but in biological terms, it\'s more about degradation. So the process is the degradation product of the inhibited dimer. So following the same logic as x8, we can take ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" and convert it into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"" or ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded_dimer"". But again, it\'s a single word. Alternatively, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_deg"" but \'deg\' is not as clear. Perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"" is better, indicating the state of being degraded.\n\nWait, but the references for x8 include EGFR and EGF, so the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So in the name, ""EGF-EGFRi"" is the ligand-receptor complex, where the receptor is inhibited. The ""*^2"" is a dimer, so two receptors. So perhaps the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". For x87, it\'s the same but degraded, so ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", which is a single word with the state. So maybe for x8, the term is ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and for x87, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \'i\' in the name stands for \'inhibited\', so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"", and the ""*^2"" is a dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". Then x87, being the degradation product, would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure if \'dimer\' is necessary, or if it\'s implied. Maybe the user just wants ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example uses ""IL6_R_active"", which combines the ligand and receptor with an underscore and then the state. So for x8, since it\'s a reactant, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the product, which is the degradation product, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include the dimer part, so maybe I should consider whether the dimer is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the ""*^2"" is a subscript indicating a dimer, so it\'s part of the term. So ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ""*^2"" is a reference to a specific form, but since the user wants a single word, I need to include it. So perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object would map x8 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and x87 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", so perhaps the format is ligand_receptor_state. So for x8, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the degraded form, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \'deg\' in x87\'s name stands for \'degraded\', so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nI think that\'s the approach to take.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The equation is Di00UU => Da00UU; L, Di00UU, L. The replacement table has several rows:\n\n1. reactants: Di00UU maps to Di00UU with reference EGFR\n2. products: Da00UU maps to Da00UU with no reference\n3. modifiers: L maps to L with reference EGF\n4. modifiers: Di00UU maps to Di00UU with reference EGFR\n5. modifiers: L maps to L with reference EGF\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically meaningful term.\n\nStarting with Di00UU. From the replacement table, the `name` is Di00UU, but the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a known receptor, I should consider it as a receptor. So, I might map Di00UU to EGFR_R. But wait, the guidelines say to use the `name` column if possible. However, in this case, the `name` is the same as the `id`, so it\'s ambiguous. Therefore, using the reference makes sense here. So, Di00UU becomes EGFR_R.\n\nNext, Da00UU. The `name` is Da00UU, and there\'s no reference. Since it\'s a product, it might be the active form of the receptor. So, using the same logic, it should be EGFR_R_active.\n\nFor L, the `name` is L, and the reference is EGF. EGF is a ligand, so L should be EGF_L.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each `id` to these terms.

If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is species_0 => species_25 + species_1, which probably represents a chemical reaction where species_0 is converted into species_25 and species_1.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries:\n- species_0: role is reactant, name is pEGFR, reference is EGFR.\n- species_25: role is product, name is EGF, reference is EGF.\n- species_1: role is product, name is free_EGFR, reference is EGFR.\n\nMy task is to map each id to a biologically accurate term.\n\nStarting with species_0: The name is pEGFR, which likely stands for phosphorylated EGFR. The reference is just EGFR, so maybe I should use the phosphorylated form since that\'s more specific. So, I\'ll map species_0 to ""EGFR phosphorylated"" but as a single word: ""EGFR_phosphorylated"".\n\nNext, species_25: The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s already a single word and well-known, I don\'t need to change it. So species_25 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nFor species_1: The name is free_EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The term ""free"" indicates that the receptor is not bound. To make it a single word, I\'ll use ""EGFR_free"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. In this case, EGFR is a receptor, so maybe I should include ""R"" for receptor. So species_0 could be ""EGFR_R_phosphorylated"" and species_1 as ""EGFR_R_free"". But the guidelines also say to use the name column if possible. The name for species_0 is pEGFR, which is phosphorylated, so maybe keeping it as ""EGFR_phosphorylated"" is better. Similarly, species_1\'s name is ""free_EGFR"", so ""EGFR_free"" seems appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word.

Each term is a single word, uses the name where possible, and includes the state if necessary. I don\'t see any ambiguity that needs resolving beyond what\'s provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Hmm, I need to look at the replacement table to see if any of the IDs are receptors or ligands.\n\nThe input provided is an equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries, two for reactants and two for products. The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR again, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K, with references like EGFR, EGF for the boundEGFR entries.\n\nSo, looking at the replacement table, the first step is to map each ID to its name. For example, bEGFR maps to boundEGFR, and PI3K maps to PI3K. Since the names are already provided, maybe I can use those as the terms unless they need further refinement.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t make significant changes. So, for PI3K, it\'s straightforward. But for bEGFR, since it\'s an abbreviation, maybe I should expand it. But the name is boundEGFR, which is more descriptive. So, I think I should use ""boundEGFR"" for the term.\n\nFor pPI3K, the name is pPI3K. I\'m not sure what the \'p\' stands for. It could be phosphorylated, so maybe I should consider that. The guidelines suggest including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term by using an underscore. So, perhaps I should map pPI3K to something like ""PI3K_phosphorylated"" or ""pPI3K_active"".\n\nBut the guidelines also mention that if the term is already reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. So, maybe ""pPI3K"" is acceptable as it is, but adding a state could make it more biologically accurate.\n\nHowever, looking back at the replacement table, the references for bEGFR include EGFR and EGF. So, perhaps EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand. So, in the replacement table, bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, which would be a receptor. So, for the term, I can use ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"". Since the name is boundEGFR, which is already descriptive, maybe I can just use that.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the name column. So, since the name is boundEGFR, I should use that as the term. Similarly, for pPI3K, the name is pPI3K, so I should use that unless I can make it more interpretable.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if pPI3K is a standard term. Maybe it\'s better to expand it to ""phosphorylated_PI3K"" or something like that. But the guidelines say to use the name column unless I can find a better term in the references. Since the references for pPI3K are empty, maybe I should just use ""pPI3K"" as is.\n\nWait, no, the references column for pPI3K is empty, so I can\'t get more information from there. So, I think I should just use the name, which is pPI3K.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its name. So, bEGFR maps to ""boundEGFR"", PI3K maps to ""PI3K"", and pPI3K maps to ""pPI3K"". Since these are all single words, they fit the guidelines.\n\nI don\'t think any of the terms need to be split into receptor or ligand because the names already indicate their state. For example, boundEGFR suggests it\'s the bound form of the receptor. So, I don\'t need to add an underscore for that.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""pPI3K"": ""pPI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it.

That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"", it could become ""IL6_R"" or something similar. But I need to check if the receptor or ligand names are in the ""name"" column. If not, I should use context or references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy. So I can\'t just stop at the `name`; I have to look into the references as well.\n\nAnother point is about states like ""bound"" or ""active."" If applicable, I should include those as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active."" But if the term is already clear as an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nThey also want me to prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column for consistency, even if the references have synonyms. So I should check both but give preference to the `name`.\n\nLooking at the input provided, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four rows with `id`, `name`, and `references`. Let me go through each `id` one by one.\n\nStarting with `bEGFR` in the reactants: the `name` is boundEGFR, and the references mention EGF and EGFR. So boundEGFR is already a descriptive name. It\'s an abbreviation, but since it\'s interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So the term for `bEGFR` would stay as ""boundEGFR.""\n\nNext is `PI3K` in reactants. The `name` is PI3K, and the references have a Miriam ID, but it\'s the same as another entry. Since PI3K is a well-known abbreviation for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and it\'s interpretable as-is, I can keep it as ""PI3K.""\n\nMoving to the products, we have another `bEGFR`, which is the same as the reactant. So it\'s also ""boundEGFR.""\n\nLastly, `pPI3K` in products. The `name` is pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K. The references include a Miriam ID for abao:0002007 and omit:0027264. Since pPI3K is an abbreviation that\'s reasonably clear, I don\'t need to change it. So it remains ""pPI3K.""\n\nI should make sure each `id` maps correctly without adding any extra words unless necessary. Since all the terms are already single words and don\'t require combining receptors or ligands, I can directly map them. Also, there\'s no need for states like ""active"" because the terms already indicate their state through the `name`.\n\nSo the final JSON should have each `id` as a key with its corresponding term.

But wait, the guidelines say to use the `name` column if possible. However, in this case, the `name` is the same as the `id`, so it\'s ambiguous. Therefore, using the reference makes sense here.

Also, I should consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. \n\nThe input includes an equation: c499 + c499 => c501. The replacement table has three rows. The first two are reactants with id c499, name ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"", and references ""EGF; EGFR"". The third row is a product with id c501, name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"", and references ""EGF; EGFR"".\n\nI need to map each id to a biologically interpretable term. Starting with c499. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"". EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 is a receptor, specifically EGFR. The ""Inh"" likely stands for ""inhibited"" or maybe ""inactive"". So combining them, I can create a single term. Since the guideline says to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1"". Now, considering the state, it\'s ""Inh"", so I\'ll add ""_inhibited"" as a state. So c499 becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_inhibited"".\n\nFor c501, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"", which probably means two molecules of the same complex. So it\'s the same as c499 but dimerized. I\'ll use the same term as c499 but add ""_dimer"" to indicate two units. So c501 becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_inhibited_dimer"".\n\nI should check if the term is a simple abbreviation. ""EGF"" and ""EGFR"" are well-known, so no changes needed. Also, the name column has priority, so I\'m using ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" as the basis. \n\nI think I\'ve covered all the guidelines: single word, connected receptor and ligand, included state, and used the name column for consistency. Now, I\'ll structure this into a JSON object as the user requested.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c5 + c105 => c116. So, we have three ids here: c5, c105, and c116. Each of these has an entry in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c5. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P. The reference column is empty, so I don\'t have any additional info. EGF is epidermal growth factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor. The _P might stand for phosphorylated. So, I think the term should combine EGF and ErbB1 with the state. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\nNext is c105. The name is ATP with a concentration value, 1.2e9. The reference is empty. ATP is adenosine triphosphate, a common molecule, so maybe just ""ATP"" is sufficient. The number is just a concentration, not part of the term.\n\nFinally, c116. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive, and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1, so it\'s consistent. The term includes EGF, ErbB1, ATP, and it\'s in the full active state. So, I need to combine these into a single term. Since it\'s active, I can add ""_active"" at the end. So, ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c5 to ""EGF_ErbB1_P"", c105 to ""ATP"", and c116 to ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Hmm, I need to look at the replacement table to see if any of the IDs are receptors or ligands.\n\nThe input provided is an equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries, two for reactants and two for products. The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR again, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K, with references like EGFR, EGF for the boundEGFR entries.\n\nSo, looking at the replacement table, the first step is to map each ID to its name. For example, bEGFR maps to boundEGFR, and PI3K maps to PI3K. Since the names are already provided, maybe I can use those as the terms unless they need further refinement.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t make significant changes. So, for PI3K, it\'s straightforward. But for bEGFR, since it\'s an abbreviation, maybe I should expand it. But the name is boundEGFR, which is more descriptive. So, I think I should use ""boundEGFR"" for the term.\n\nFor pPI3K, the name is pPI3K. I\'m not sure what the \'p\' stands for. It could be phosphorylated, so maybe I should consider that. The guidelines suggest including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term by using an underscore. So, perhaps I should map pPI3K to something like ""PI3K_phosphorylated"" or ""pPI3K_active"".\n\nBut the guidelines also mention that if the term is already reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. So, maybe ""pPI3K"" is acceptable as it is, but adding a state could make it more biologically accurate.\n\nHowever, looking back at the replacement table, the references for bEGFR include EGFR and EGF. So, perhaps EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand. So, in the replacement table, bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, which would be a receptor. So, for the term, I can use ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"". Since the name is boundEGFR, which is already descriptive, maybe I can just use that.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the name column. So, since the name is boundEGFR, I should use that as the term. Similarly, for pPI3K, the name is pPI3K, so I should use that unless I can make it more interpretable.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if pPI3K is a standard term. Maybe it\'s better to expand it to ""phosphorylated_PI3K"" or something like that. But the guidelines say to use the name column unless I can find a better term in the references. Since the references for pPI3K are empty, maybe I should just use ""pPI3K"" as is.\n\nWait, no, the references column for pPI3K is empty, so I can\'t get more information from there. So, I think I should just use the name, which is pPI3K.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its name. So, bEGFR maps to ""boundEGFR"", PI3K maps to ""PI3K"", and pPI3K maps to ""pPI3K"". Since these are all single words, they fit the guidelines.\n\nI don\'t think any of the terms need to be split into receptor or ligand because the names already indicate their state. For example, boundEGFR suggests it\'s the bound form of the receptor. So, I don\'t need to add an underscore for that.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""pPI3K"": ""pPI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it. I don\'t see any need for further changes because all the terms are single words and they\'re already interpretable based on the replacement table.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. Also, I should include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Prioritize the `name` column over `references` for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided, there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is Di00UU + L => DiL00UU; Di00UU, L. The replacement table has four entries.\n\nLet\'s go through each row in the replacement table:\n\n1. **Di00UU**: The role is reactants, id is Di00UU, name is Di00UU, references is EGFR. Since the name is the same as the id, and the reference is EGFR, which is a well-known receptor. So, I should map Di00UU to EGFR. Since it\'s a receptor, maybe I should write it as EGFR_R? But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is Di00UU, but the reference is EGFR. Hmm, but the guidelines mention that if the name isn\'t specific, use the reference. So perhaps I should map Di00UU to EGFR_R because it\'s a receptor.\n\n2. **L**: Role is reactants, id is L, name is L, reference is EGF. So L stands for EGF, which is a ligand. So I should map L to EGF_L.\n\n3. **DiL00UU**: Role is products, id is DiL00UU, name is DiL00UU, no references. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely a complex of Di00UU and L. So combining EGFR and EGF, it would be EGFR_EGF.\n\n4. **Modifiers**: There are two more entries for Di00UU and L, both modifiers. I think these are the same as the reactants, so their mappings would be the same: Di00UU as EGFR_R and L as EGF_L.\n\nWait, but the modifiers might refer to the same entities, so their terms are the same as in reactants. So in the JSON, each id is a key, and their values are the terms.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""EGFR_EGF""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines. I should make sure each term is a single word, and I\'ve connected receptor and ligand with underscores where necessary. Also, I used the references when the name wasn\'t specific enough. The modifiers don\'t need separate entries since they\'re the same as the reactants.\n\nI don\'t see any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" mentioned, so I don\'t need to include those. The terms are already interpretable as-is, so I didn\'t make any significant changes beyond mapping the ids to their biological terms.\n\nI think that\'s all. I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: R + EGF => Ra. Then there\'s a replacement table with four columns: role, id, name, and references. The table has three entries for reactants and one for products.\n\nThe first thing I notice is the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON should be a single word. So I need to make sure each id is mapped to a term that\'s concise. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For R, the name is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. So R stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Since it\'s a receptor, I should connect it with an underscore. So R becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n  \n- EGF\'s name is Epidermal_Growth_Factor, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I need to append ""_L"" to it. So EGF becomes ""EGF_L"".\n\n- Ra\'s name is EGF_EGFR, and the references are EGFR and EGF. This is a product, so it\'s the bound form of the receptor and ligand. I should combine them with an underscore and add ""_bound"" to indicate the state. So Ra becomes ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nI should also check if any two-step process is needed. For example, mapping from id to name first and then refining. In this case, R maps directly to EGFR, which is a receptor, so no further refinement is needed beyond adding ""_R"". Similarly, EGF maps directly to its name, so adding ""_L"" suffices.\n\nI need to ensure that I\'m not making unnecessary changes if the term is already interpretable. For example, if an id is ""IL6"", I wouldn\'t change it unless there\'s a more specific term in the references.\n\nAlso, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the \'name\' column if there are synonyms. In this case, all the names are pretty straightforward, so that\'s fine.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the cases. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is the id and the value is the corresponding term with the appropriate suffixes.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` refers to a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and add them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe replacement table has four columns: role, id, name, and references. For each `id`, I need to look at the `name` and `references` to determine the correct term. If the `name` is an abbreviation or can be interpreted as-is, I leave it. But if it\'s ambiguous, I use the references to find a more accurate term.\n\nLooking at the input equation: c143 + c499 => c494. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. c143 is ErbB4 with no references.\n2. c499 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, references are EGF and EGFR.\n3. c494 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4, references are EGF and EGFR.\n\nI need to map each `id` to a single word term. Let\'s start with c143. The name is ErbB4, which is a known receptor. So, the term should be ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c499. The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh. The references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. ""Inh"" might stand for inhibitor, but in the context of signaling, it\'s more likely indicating that EGF is bound to EGFR. So, combining the ligand and receptor, it should be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNow, c494. The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4, and references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like the product of the reaction where EGF is bound to EGFR and also associated with ErbB4. So, the term should include both receptors. Since EGFR is the same as ErbB1, the term becomes ""EGF_EGFR_ErbB4"".\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word, using underscores to connect ligands and receptors, and include states if necessary. In this case, the states like ""bound"" aren\'t explicitly mentioned, so I focus on the components involved.\n\nSo, the final JSON should map each id to these terms without any additional explanations or comments.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c3 + c502 => c504. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c3, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, maybe I should combine them into a single term. The format is ligand_receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. But wait, the guidelines mention if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So I think it\'s EGF as ligand and ErbB1 as receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I\'m not sure if I should include it. The guidelines say to use context, so maybe just EGF_ErbB1.\n\n- For c502, the name is ""ErbB2:Inh"" and no references. Since it\'s a receptor and inhibitor, maybe ErbB2 is a receptor, so maybe it\'s just ErbB2. Or since it\'s an inhibitor, perhaps Inh is the ligand? But I\'m not sure. The guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms. Since ""Inh"" is unclear, maybe I should look at the products. The product c504 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh. So perhaps c502 is just ErbB2, so the term is ErbB2.\n\n- For c504, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh"" and references EGF, EGFR. This seems to combine all three, so the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2, but since it\'s bound, maybe add _bound. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to consider states like bound or active. In the product, the state might be bound because it\'s a product of the reaction. So I think c504 should include the state. So combining EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and the state, it becomes EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nc3: EGF_ErbB1\n\nc502: ErbB2\n\nc504: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me double-check each step to make sure I didn\'t miss anything.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c146 + c105 => c127. Each of these ids (c146, c105, c127) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c146, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, and references are EGF; EGFR. The guidelines say that if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, I can combine them with an underscore. So EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. But in the name, it\'s listed as EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, which seems like a complex of the ligand and two receptors. So maybe I can create a single term by combining them. Perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9, but the references are empty. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple term, don\'t change it. So I\'ll just keep it as ""ATP"".\n\nFor c127, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3:ATP, and the references are the same as c146. So similar to c146, this is a complex but including ATP. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_ATP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, using underscores to connect parts. Since the guidelines allow for states like active or bound, but in this case, there\'s no such indication, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nLet me structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each id maps to the combined term without any additional changes unless necessary. I think this should satisfy the requirements.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c163 + c105 => c124. There are three ids here: c163, c105, and c124. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c163. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB3)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB3 is HER3. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be a single word combining these. Since both are receptors, I can write them as EGFR_HER3_P. That makes sense because it\'s a complex of EGFR and HER3 in a phosphorylated state.\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"". The number seems to be a concentration or something, but the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"" as the term.\n\nFor c124, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP"" and the references include EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term should combine the ligand and receptors. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the complex is EGF bound to EGFR and HER3 (ErbB3). So, the term should be EGF_EGFR_HER3_ATP. This includes the ligand, both receptors, and the ATP.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, considering the state like active or bound is important, but in this case, the name doesn\'t specify a state beyond the presence of ATP. So, combining them as such should suffice.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON will have keys c163, c105, and c124 with their respective terms.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the guidelines and the input data provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table, there are three entries:\n\n1. species_25 is EGF, with the reference also being EGF.\n2. species_1 is freeEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n3. species_0 is boundEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term should be a single word, and if possible, receptors and ligands should be connected with an underscore. Also, if there are states like bound or active, they should be included with an underscore.\n\nStarting with species_25: the name is EGF, which is already a single word and a well-known ligand. There\'s no need to change it, so it maps directly to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, species_1 is freeEGFReceptor. The name is already descriptive, but according to the guidelines, if we can identify a specific receptor or ligand, we should use an underscore. The reference for this is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, freeEGFReceptor can be simplified to ""EGFR"" because it\'s the receptor for EGF. Since it\'s the receptor, we don\'t need the ""Receptor"" part; just ""EGFR"" suffices.\n\nThen, species_0 is boundEGFReceptor. Again, the reference is EGFR. Since this is the bound state, we can include ""bound"" as part of the term. So, following the guideline, we would combine the receptor name with the state: ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nWait, but looking back, the guidelines mention that if the name is already simple and interpretable, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. However, in this case, species_1 and species_0 both have the same reference, EGFR. So, perhaps species_1 is the free form and species_0 is the bound form. Therefore, mapping species_1 to ""EGFR"" and species_0 to ""EGFR_bound"" makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there\'s any ambiguity. The name for species_1 is ""freeEGFReceptor,"" which clearly indicates it\'s the free form of the receptor. The name for species_0 is ""boundEGFReceptor,"" indicating it\'s bound to EGF. So, mapping them to ""EGFR"" and ""EGFR_bound"" respectively seems appropriate.\n\nDouble-checking the guidelines: we need to use the name column first, but if the reference provides a more specific term, we can use that. In this case, the name for species_1 is ""freeEGFReceptor,"" but the reference is EGFR, so we should use ""EGFR"" as the term for species_1. Similarly, species_0\'s name is ""boundEGFReceptor,"" but using ""EGFR_bound"" aligns with the reference and the guidelines.\n\nTherefore, the JSON should map:\n- species_25 to ""EGF""\n- species_1 to ""EGFR""\n- species_0 to ""EGFR_bound""\n\nI think that\'s correct. It follows the guidelines, uses the references appropriately, and keeps each term as a single word where possible, incorporating the state when necessary.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"", it could become ""IL6_R"" or something similar. But I need to check if the receptor or ligand names are in the ""name"" column. If not, I should use context or references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy. So I can\'t just stop at the `name`; I have to look into the references as well.\n\nAnother point is about states like ""bound"" or ""active."" If applicable, I should include those as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active."" But if the term is already clear as an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nThey also want me to prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column for consistency, even if the references have synonyms. So I should check both but give preference to the `name`.\n\nLooking at the input provided, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four rows with `id`, `name`, and `references`. Let me go through each `id` one by one.\n\nStarting with `bEGFR` in the reactants: the `name` is boundEGFR, and the references mention EGF and EGFR. So boundEGFR is already a descriptive name. It\'s an abbreviation, but since it\'s interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So the term for `bEGFR` would stay as ""boundEGFR.""\n\nNext is `PI3K` in reactants. The `name` is PI3K, and the references have a Miriam ID, but it\'s the same as another entry. Since PI3K is a well-known abbreviation for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and it\'s interpretable as-is, I can keep it as ""PI3K.""\n\nMoving to the products, we have another `bEGFR`, which is the same as the reactant. So it\'s also ""boundEGFR.""\n\nLastly, `pPI3K` in products. The `name` is pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K. The references include a Miriam ID for abao:0002007 and omit:0027264. Since pPI3K is an abbreviation that\'s reasonably clear, I don\'t need to change it. So it remains ""pPI3K.""\n\nI should make sure each `id` maps correctly without adding any extra words unless necessary. Since all the terms are already single words and don\'t require combining receptors or ligands, I can directly map them. Also, there\'s no need for states like ""active"" because the terms already indicate their state through the `name`.\n\nSo the final JSON should have each `id` as a key with its corresponding term. I\'ll structure it accordingly without any explanations, just the JSON object as requested.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

I need to use context and references to figure them out accurately.\n\nAnother point is that sometimes a two-step process is needed. I might first map the `id` to the `name` using the table and then refine it further using the references for better biological accuracy.

So, if a protein is in a bound state, I would name it like ""IL6_R_active"" instead of just ""IL6_R"".\n\nIf the term is already a simple abbreviation or is easily understandable as is, I shouldn\'t change it much. It\'s about balance—making it interpretable without overcomplicating it.\n\nThe user also mentioned that if the `name` and `reference` columns have similar terms or synonyms, I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency and clarity.

The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each `id`:\n\n1. **bEGFR**: The `name` is ""boundEGFR"", and the references point to EGFR and EGF. Since ""boundEGFR"" is already a specific term indicating the bound state of EGFR, I can map it directly to ""boundEGFR"".\n\n2. **PI3K**: The `name` is ""PI3K"", and the references are urn:miriam:omit:0027264. PI3K is a well-known acronym for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It\'s a simple abbreviation, so I don\'t need to change it.\n\n3. **bEGFR** again, same as the first one, so it maps to ""boundEGFR"".\n\n4. **pPI3K**: The `name` is ""pPI3K"", and the references include urn:miriam:omit:0027264 and urn:miriam:bao:0002007. ""pPI3K"" stands for phosphorylated PI3K, indicating an active state. So, I can map this to ""pPI3K"".\n\nI need to make sure that each `id` is correctly mapped, and if any of these terms require further refinement based on the references, I should do that. But in this case, the names are straightforward and already provide the necessary biological context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have each `id` as a key and the corresponding term as the value. The final output would be a JSON object with ""bEGFR"" mapped to ""boundEGFR"" and ""PI3K"" and ""pPI3K"" mapped to their respective terms.\n\nI should double-check to ensure that all terms are single words and that any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" are included. Since ""boundEGFR"" already includes the state, and ""pPI3K"" implies phosphorylation (an active state), I don\'t need to add anything else.\n\nI think that covers everything. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x5 => x8, which I think represents a reaction where x5 transforms into x8. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n- For x5, the name is EGF-EGFR*^2, and references are EGFR; EGF.\n- For x8, the name is EGF-EGFRi*^2, with the same references.\n\nI need to map each id (x5 and x8) to a term. Let\'s start with x5.\n\nThe name for x5 is EGF-EGFR*^2. The asterisk and superscript 2 might indicate something about the binding state or activity. The references are EGFR and EGF, which are ligand and receptor. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, the term should combine EGF and EGFR. Since it\'s a receptor-ligand complex, I can join them with an underscore: EGF_EGFR.\n\nNow, considering the state indicated by *^2. Maybe it signifies a bound or active state. The guidelines mention adding states like ""active"" with an underscore. So, if *^2 represents an active state, the term would be EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nMoving on to x8. Its name is EGF-EGFRi*^2. The \'i\' might stand for inactive. So, this would be the inactive form of the receptor-ligand complex. Following the same logic, it would be EGF_EGFR_inactive.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column\'s phrasing for consistency. The names are EGF-EGFR*^2 and EGF-EGFRi*^2, so maybe the \'i\' is important. So, perhaps x5 is the active complex and x8 is the inactive complex.\n\nPutting it all together, x5 would map to EGF_EGFR_active, and x8 to EGF_EGFR_inactive. I need to ensure each term is a single word, so using underscores is correct.\n\nI think that\'s the solution. Let me double-check: each id is mapped to a single word, combining receptor and ligand with an underscore, and including the state if applicable. The references support using EGFR and EGF, so the terms make sense biologically.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: x11 => x8. Then there\'s a replacement table with three columns: role, id, name, and references.\n\nLooking at the table, x11 is in the reactants with the name ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" and no references. x8 is in the products with the name ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"".\n\nI need to map each id (x11 and x8) to a biologically meaningful term. The guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation or interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much. But in this case, the names seem a bit complex with the ""i^2"" and ""i*^2"".\n\nWait, the term for x11 is ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". Maybe ""i"" stands for inactive, and the superscript 2 could indicate dimerization or something. Similarly, x8 is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", where ""*"" might indicate active. But I\'m not sure about the exact meaning of these symbols. Since the references for x8 are ""EGFR; EGF"", perhaps the active form is just ""EGFR_EGF"".\n\nBut the name for x11 is a bit confusing. It has ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". Maybe ""i^2"" is a way to denote a modified form. But without more context, I might have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" is just a placeholder for an inactive form, but since the name is a bit unclear, I should look for a more interpretable term.\n\nHowever, the guidelines suggest that if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe I should just use the name as it is, but replace it with a more standard term. Since the references for x8 are EGFR and EGF, perhaps x8 represents the active form, so maybe ""EGFR_EGF_active"".\n\nWait, but the output in the example was {""x11"": ""EGF-EGFRi"", ""x8"": ""EGFR_EGF""}. So maybe the approach is to take the name and simplify it by removing the superscripts, keeping it as ""EGF-EGFRi"" for x11 and ""EGFR_EGF"" for x8.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because the guidelines suggest connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So maybe x8 should be ""EGFR_EGF"" to indicate the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nAs for x11, ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" might be a way to denote an inactive form. So maybe ""EGF-EGFRi"" is acceptable, or perhaps ""EGFR_EGF_inactive"". But without more context, it\'s hard to say. The example output uses ""EGF-EGFRi"" for x11, so maybe that\'s the way to go.\n\nI should also consider the guidelines about states. If the term includes a state like ""active"" or ""bound,"" it should be part of the term with an underscore. But in this case, the names don\'t explicitly state the state, so maybe it\'s better to keep it simple.\n\nSo, in the JSON output, I\'ll map x11 to ""EGF-EGFRi"" and x8 to ""EGFR_EGF"". That seems to align with the example provided and the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The first row is for reactants with id RP, name (EGF_EGFR)2-P, and reference EGFR. The second row is products with id R2, name (EGF_EGFR)2, and references EGF and EGFR.\n\nI need to map each id (RP and R2) to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with RP. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P. The reference is EGFR. Hmm, EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. So, (EGF_EGFR)2-P probably refers to the ligand-receptor complex in a phosphorylated state. The P likely stands for phosphorylated. So, combining EGF and EGFR with an underscore and adding the state, I get ""EGF_EGFR_bound_phosphorylated"".\n\nNow for R2. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2, and the references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like the active form of the complex, maybe after dimerization. So, using the same logic, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. Also, prioritize the name column\'s phrasing. RP\'s name is a bit more specific, so using that for clarity. R2\'s name is simpler but still meaningful.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map RP to ""EGF_EGFR_bound_phosphorylated"" and R2 to ""EGF_EGFR_active"". That should fulfill the user\'s requirements.', '', '', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c159 => c86. So, I need to map both c159 and c86 to their respective terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), and the references are EGF and EGFR. The role is reactants. For c86, the name is R_degraded, with no references provided, and the role is products.\n\nStarting with c159: The name is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since the guidelines suggest combining ligand and receptor with an underscore, I should consider the ligand first. EGF is the ligand, so I\'ll take ""EGF"" as the ligand part. Now, for the receptors, ErbB1 is also known as EGFR, which is the primary receptor for EGF. ErbB2 is another receptor that can form heterodimers with EGFR. So, in this case, the primary receptor is EGFR (ErbB1), and ErbB2 is a co-receptor.\n\nBut the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so I think the main interaction here is EGF binding to EGFR. The presence of ErbB2 might indicate a dimerization, but for the purpose of creating a single word, I should focus on the main components. So, combining the ligand EGF with the receptor EGFR would give ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2). So, perhaps it\'s more accurate to represent it as a complex. Since the guideline says to create a single word by connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore, I think ""EGF_EGFR"" makes sense because EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. ErbB2 might be part of the receptor complex, but since EGFR is the primary, maybe we can just use EGFR for the receptor part. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, and ErbB2 is another receptor, perhaps we can denote the complex as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2, but that\'s more than two parts. But the guideline says to make a single word, so perhaps just the primary ligand and receptor: EGF_EGFR.\n\nNow, looking at c86: the name is R_degraded. The references are empty. The role is products. So, R is likely a receptor. Since in the equation, c159 is a reactant, and c86 is a product, it\'s probably the degradation product of the receptor. So, R_degraded would be the degraded form of the receptor. From c159, we identified that the receptor is EGFR, so R in c86 would correspond to EGFR. Therefore, the term would be ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map c159 to ""EGF_EGFR"" and c86 to ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. However, in this case, c159 is mapped to (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), which is a complex, so it\'s better to make it more interpretable. Similarly, R_degraded is ambiguous, so we need to specify which receptor it is, which we can infer from the reactants.\n\nSo, yes, the mapping would be:\n\n{\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""c86"": ""EGFR_degraded""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach.

The \'id\' is Shc, and both \'name\' and references are empty. Shc is a known adaptor protein in signaling pathways, often associated with receptors like EGFR. Since there\'s no reference, I\'ll use Shc as-is, but maybe it can be more specific. However, since the guidelines say if it\'s reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it. So Shc remains Shc.\n\nThen, Rp_Shc. The product\'s \'id\' is Rp_Shc, and the reference is EGFR. So, since Rp is EGFR, and Shc is the adaptor, Rp_Shc would be the complex of EGFR and Shc. Therefore, it should be EGFR_Shc.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if it\'s a two-step process, first map the \'id\' to \'name\' using the table, then refine using references.

The third entry is ""Rp"" with references ""EGF; EGFR"". The role is modifier. So, Rp is an abbreviation. The references suggest it\'s related to EGF or EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, maybe Rp stands for Receptor Phosphorylated or something similar. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. So, I\'ll map ""Rp"" to ""EGF"" or ""EGFR""? Wait, the references have both EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, EGFR is the receptor. Since the role is modifier, maybe it\'s the receptor. So, I might map Rp to ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say if the name is in the name column, use that. Since the name is empty, I have to use the references.

My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c280. The name is RTK_Pase. The references are empty. RTK stands for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, and Pase might be a specific form or state. Since it\'s already a single word, and according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it. So, c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nNext is c11. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP). The references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. So, this is a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. The name is a bit complicated. The guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor. So, I should map this to ""EGF_ErbB1"". The number 2 in the name might indicate dimerization or multiple binding, but the guidelines don\'t mention handling numbers, so I\'ll ignore that for now.\n\nNow, c415 is the product. Its name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. The references are empty. The term is a bit complex. It has EGF:ErbB1 with a _P suffix and RTK_Pase. The _P might indicate phosphorylation or another state. From the guidelines, if there\'s a state like active or bound, it should be included. So, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" is the state here, and it\'s associated with RTK_Pase.

Alternatively, since RTK_Pase is the same as c280, perhaps the product combines both.\n\nWait, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase.

So, perhaps I should split this into two parts: EGF_ErbB1_P and RTK_Pase. But since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a single term combining both, like ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"".\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure.

But since RTK_Pase is c280, which is a reactant, the product is likely the active form of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nSo, perhaps c415 is ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe I should go with ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" as the term, including the state.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nc280 → RTK_Pase\n\nc11 → EGF_ErbB1\n\nc415 → EGF_ErbB1_P\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, c11\'s references include EGFR, which is ErbB1. So, perhaps it\'s better to use ""EGF_EGFR"" instead of ""EGF_ErbB1"", but the name column says EGF:ErbB1, so I should prioritize that.\n\nSo, c11 is EGF_ErbB1.\n\nc415 is EGF_ErbB1_P.\n\nI think that\'s the best approach.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""R"" maps to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to check if the \'id\'s correspond to receptors or ligands. \n\nLooking at the input, the equation is a bit confusing: it\'s an id on the left pointing to another id on the right. The replacement table has three entries. The first two have the same id, mw0be0d193_fd6b_4824_8928_dbade8b5c99c, with role \'reactants\' and \'modifiers\', both mapping to EGF. The third id, mw280197c8_98de_43f0_bf01_0f332a1ab689, is a product and maps to EGFR.\n\nSo, I need to map each id to its corresponding term. The first id is EGF, which is a ligand. The second id is EGFR, which is a receptor. \n\nAccording to the guidelines, if it\'s a ligand or receptor, I should connect them with an underscore. But in the replacement table, EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, I should represent them as EGF_L and EGFR_R.\n\nI don\'t see any states mentioned, so I don\'t need to add anything like \'active\' or \'bound\'. Also, the names are already clear, so I don\'t need to change them. \n\nSo, the JSON should have two entries: the first id maps to ""EGF_L"" and the second to ""EGFR_R"". That should satisfy the requirements.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c160 => c86. So, I need to map c160 and c86 based on the replacement table provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, the first row has role \'reactants\', id \'c160\', name \'(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)\', and references \'EGF; EGFR\'. The second row is \'products\', id \'c86\', name \'R_degraded\', and no references.\n\nStarting with c160: The name is a complex of EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB3. The references list EGF and EGFR. So, EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. Since the name includes the ligand and receptors, I need to find a single word that represents this complex. Since the name is already quite specific, I can take it as is but ensure it\'s a single term. So, \'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3\' makes sense. It\'s specific and combines ligand and receptors.\n\nNext, c86: The name is \'R_degraded\'. The guidelines suggest that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. But since the name here is \'R_degraded\', it\'s already a compound term. So, I should map c86 to \'R_degraded\' without changes. It clearly indicates the receptor is degraded, which is biologically meaningful.\n\nI also need to ensure that the JSON object uses the \'id\' as the key and the term as the value. So, the structure should be:\n\n{\n  ""c160"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3"",\n  ""c86"": ""R_degraded""\n}\n\nI think this meets all the guidelines. The terms are single words, and I\'ve combined ligand and receptors for c160, while c86 is left as is because it\'s already a clear term. No two-step process was needed here because the names were sufficiently clear in the replacement table.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c280 + c159 => c416. Each of these ids (c280, c159, c416) corresponds to a term in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a single word term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c280:\n- Role is reactants, id is c280, name is RTK_Pase, references are empty. Since RTK_Pase is a known term and it\'s already a single word, I can keep it as is. So c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nFor c159:\n- Role is reactants, id is c159, name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2)"", references are EGF; EGFR. The name looks like a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB2. According to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are EGFR (since EGFR is another name for ErbB1). So I can write it as ""EGF_EGFR"". The name includes all three, but since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, that\'s sufficient. So c159 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nFor c416:\n- Role is products, id is c416, name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"", references are empty. The name indicates a phosphorylated form (P) of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 complex, along with RTK_Pase. Since RTK_Pase is already mapped to c280, and the product is the active form, perhaps it\'s ""RTK_Pase_active"". Alternatively, since it\'s a phosphorylated state, maybe ""RTK_Pase_phosphorylated"". But the guidelines mention using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. So ""RTK_Pase_active"" makes sense as the active form after the reaction.\n\nWait, but the name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"". So maybe it\'s the RTK_Pase in an active state due to phosphorylation. So I think ""RTK_Pase_active"" is appropriate.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map:\nc280 to ""RTK_Pase"",\nc159 to ""EGF_EGFR"",\nc416 to ""RTK_Pase_active"".\n\nI should make sure each is a single word with underscores as needed, and use the names from the table if possible. Also, using the references, for c159, the references include EGF and EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"" is accurate. For c416, since the name is about phosphorylation, ""active"" is a state that can be appended.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c500, c105, and c115. Each has a name and references. My goal is to map each id to a single word term, possibly combining receptors and ligands with an underscore, or adding states like 'bound' or 'active'.\n\nLooking at c500, the name is a complex: (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh). The references are EGF, ATP, and EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (which is EGFR). The structure seems to be EGF bound to EGFR with ATP and Inh (which I think is an inhibitor). Since it's a complex, maybe it's in an active state because ATP is a common energy source for activation. So I can combine ligand and receptor as EGF_EGFR and add 'active' as a state. That gives EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNext, c105's name is ATP with a concentration (1.2e9), but the references are empty. Since it's just ATP, and there's no additional info, I'll keep it as ATP. It's a simple term, so no need to change it.\n\nFor c115, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh)-HalfActive. The references are empty here too. The structure is similar to c500 but it's half-active. So, using the same ligand and receptor combination, I get EGF_EGFR, and since it's half-active, the term becomes EGF_EGFR_halfactive.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, so I use underscores to join parts. Also, I prioritize the name column's phrasing for consistency. I didn't find any ambiguity here, so the terms are straightforward.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its term. I think I've covered all the guidelines, so let me put it all together."", 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see what I have here.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c499 + c529 => c551. Then there\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nLooking at the guidelines, I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include them with an underscore.\n\nStarting with c499. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and the reference is ""EGF; EGFR"". EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So I should combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"". The ""Inh"" might mean inhibited, but the guidelines say to use context. Maybe it\'s not needed here since it\'s already part of the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c529. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The references are empty, so I\'ll rely on the name. ""ErbB1"" is the same as EGFR, and ""h"" could stand for the homo dimer or perhaps the receptor in a certain state. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe it\'s an active state. So I can combine as ""EGFR_ATP"".\n\nNow, c551. The name is a complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:Inh::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". The product is a combination of c499 and c529. Since they\'re both EGF and EGFR, the product would be a complex. So I\'ll combine them with an underscore: ""EGF_EGFR_complex"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word. I think I\'ve done that by combining with underscores. Also, I\'m not adding any states unless they\'re part of the name. I\'m keeping it simple as per the guidelines, so no extra changes unless necessary.\n\nLet me double-check. c499: EGF and EGFR, so EGF_EGFR. c529: EGFR with ATP, so EGFR_ATP. c551: the complex of both, so EGFR_EGFR_complex.

The replacement table has three entries:\n\n- c1 is EGF, with a reference to EGF.\n- c286 is ErbB1:Inh, with a reference to EGFR.\n- c499 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, with references to EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, I need to map each id to a term. Let\'s start with c1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. EGF is a well-known ligand, so I can keep it as is since it\'s a single word and already interpretable.\n\nNext is c286. The name is ErbB1:Inh, and the reference is EGFR. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor. The "":Inh"" part might stand for inhibitor, but I\'m not sure. However, the guidelines say if a term can be identified as a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should represent it as something like ""EGFR_R"". The "":Inh"" might indicate an inhibited state, so maybe ""EGFR_R_inactive"" or ""EGFR_R_bound"". But the references say EGFR, so maybe I can just use ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, c499. The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like a complex, maybe the ligand-receptor complex. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor, the complex would be EGF bound to EGFR. The "":Inh"" part might indicate that the receptor is in an inhibited state. So, combining them with an underscore and adding the state, it could be ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c1 to ""EGF"", c286 to ""EGFR_R"", and c499 to ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"". I should double-check to ensure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. For c286, I considered if it should include \'inactive\' but since the name is ErbB1:Inh, it\'s better to include the state. However, the references just say EGFR, so maybe \'EGFR_R\' is sufficient.

The replacement table has three entries: c3, c529, and c550. Let\'s break them down.\n\nStarting with c3: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references are ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The term should be a single word. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, maybe combine them as EGF_EGFR. But wait, the name includes ATP, but the guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible. So, I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c529: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The ""h"" might indicate a conformational state, like ""active"" or ""bound"". So, perhaps this is EGF bound to the active form of EGFR. So, the term could be EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNow, c550: The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". This looks like a dimer or complex of two EGF-EGFR-ATP units, one in the regular state and one in the active state. So, maybe it\'s the active dimer. Combining them, it would be EGF_EGFR_dimer_active.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'ll use underscores to connect them. Also, I\'ll check if any of the terms can be simplified. For c3 and c529, they both involve EGF and EGFR, just different states. c550 is a complex of both, so the dimer with active state makes sense.\n\nLet me review the guidelines again. Do I need to include the ATP? The guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible, so maybe omitting ATP is okay since it\'s part of the reaction but not the primary biological term.

The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is unless it can be more specific. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, ErbB1 is a receptor, and ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate. But since the name already combines them with colons, maybe it\'s better to use the more interpretable form. But the guideline says if it\'s reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much.

Since it\'s a single word and already a known receptor, I can leave it as ErbB4.\n\nNow, c161: The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4)"" and references are EGF and EGFR.

My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c280. The name is RTK_Pase. The references are empty. RTK stands for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase, and Pase might be a specific form or state. Since it\'s already a single word, and according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it. So, c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nNext is c11. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP). The references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. So, this is a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. The name is a bit complicated. The guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor. So, I should map this to ""EGF_ErbB1"". The number 2 in the name might indicate dimerization or multiple binding, but the guidelines don\'t mention handling numbers, so I\'ll ignore that for now.\n\nNow, c415 is the product. Its name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. The references are empty. The term is a bit complex. It has EGF:ErbB1 with a _P suffix and RTK_Pase. The _P might indicate phosphorylation or another state. From the guidelines, if there\'s a state like active or bound, it should be included. So, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" is the state here, and it\'s associated with RTK_Pase. But since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form. So, maybe the term is ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_active"". But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since RTK_Pase is the same as c280, perhaps the product combines both.\n\nWait, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. So it\'s a complex of EGF_ErbB1 in a phosphorylated state and RTK_Pase. But in the guidelines, for products, I should create a single word if possible. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. So, maybe the term is ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"".\n\nBut looking back, c280 is RTK_Pase, which is a reactant. So, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex. So, combining EGF (ligand) and ErbB1 (receptor), and the state is active or bound. So, ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_active"". Since the guidelines mention using states with an underscore, I\'ll go with ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" because the EGF is bound to ErbB1.\n\nWait, but the product\'s name has a _P suffix, which might stand for phosphorylated. So, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_P"". Alternatively, perhaps the RTK_Pase is the active form, so combining the two, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_Pase"". But I\'m not entirely sure. I think ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" is more accurate since the _P usually denotes phosphorylation.\n\nAlternatively, since c415 is the product of c280 and c11, which are RTK_Pase and EGF_ErbB1. So, maybe the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex, so ""EGF_ErbB1_active"".\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused. Let me check the guidelines again. They say if a receptor and ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, so ""EGF_ErbB1"". Then, if there\'s a state like active or bound, add it as a suffix with an underscore.\n\nIn the product, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. So, the _P might indicate that the complex is in a certain state, perhaps active. So, the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_P"". But I\'m not entirely sure if _P stands for phosphorylated or active. Since RTKs are often activated by dimerization and phosphorylation, maybe it\'s phosphorylated. So, ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" would be the term.\n\nWait, but the product\'s name also includes RTK_Pase. So, perhaps it\'s the same as c280, but in a different state. Alternatively, maybe the product is the active form of the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""EGF_ErbB1_P"" for c415 because the _P likely indicates a state, such as phosphorylation, which is a key step in RTK activation.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- c280: RTK_Pase (as is)\n- c11: EGF_ErbB1 (combining ligand and receptor)\n- c415: EGF_ErbB1_P (state included)\n\nI think that makes sense. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to use the name column first, then references if needed. For c11, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP), but the references include EGFR, which is ErbB1. So, I think connecting EGF and ErbB1 is correct.\n\nFor c415, the name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P:RTK_Pase. So, the _P is a state, so adding that as a suffix. So, the term is ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\nYes, that seems right.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c526, c499, and c554. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c526 is a reactant. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh"". I need to parse this. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is a receptor. The ""h"" might stand for ""homodimer"" or something similar, and ""Inh"" could be an inhibitor. But since the guidelines say to use context, maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s state. So combining them, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh"". But wait, the guidelines mention using underscores for receptors and ligands. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_h"" with the state ""Inh"". So the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h_Inh"".\n\nNext, c499 is another reactant with the name ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and references EGF and EGFR. Since the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"", and the reference confirms it\'s EGF and EGFR (which is ErbB1), I can map it similarly. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_Inh"".\n\nNow, c554 is a product, and the name is a bit more complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:Inh::EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh)"". The double colon might indicate a complex or dimer. So combining the two, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh"" combined with itself. But since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s the active form. So the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"". Alternatively, since both are Inh, perhaps it\'s a dimer in the active state. So combining them, it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to make it a single word. So I should use underscores. So c554 would be ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"", but perhaps the state is already part of the name, so maybe just ""EGF_ErbB1_h:Inh_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term as I derived.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the replacement table. There are three entries: c3, c526, and c527. Each has a role, id, name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term based on the name and references, following the guidelines.\n\nStarting with c3. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"". I remember from the guidelines that if a term is a simple abbreviation or interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it much. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 is a receptor. So, according to the example, we connect them with an underscore. So EGF as the ligand would be ""EGF_L"" and ErbB1 as the receptor would be ""ErbB1_R"". Since the name includes both, I can combine them as ""EGF_ErbB1_R"". The ATP is part of the name, but since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s just part of the process, so I\'ll focus on the receptor and ligand part.\n\nNext, c526. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh"". The ""h"" might stand for ""homodimer"" or ""heterodimer,"" and ""Inh"" could mean inhibited or inactivated. So this is the inhibited form of the EGF-ErbB1 complex. Using the guidelines, I should include the state, so I\'ll add ""_inhibited"" at the end. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_R_inhibited"".\n\nThen, c527. The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh)"". This looks like a complex formed by the two reactants. So combining the two, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_R_bound_EGF_ErbB1_R_inhibited"". This shows the binding between the active and inhibited forms.\n\nI should also check the references for each id to ensure accuracy. For c3, the references are EGF, ATP, and EGFR. That confirms that EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, so ""EGF_ErbB1_R"" makes sense. For c526, since there are no references, I have to rely on the name, so I\'m a bit uncertain but proceed with the name\'s info. For c527, again, no references, so I use the name\'s structure to form the term.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, if a state like ""bound"" or ""active"" is present, I include it. Since c527 is a product, it\'s the bound state, so I add ""_bound"" between the two complexes.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id correctly with the terms I\'ve derived. I think this covers all the guidelines, so I can proceed to create the JSON.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c280 + c159 => c416. Each of these ids (c280, c159, c416) corresponds to a term in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a single word term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c280:\n- Role is reactants, id is c280, name is RTK_Pase, references are empty. Since RTK_Pase is a known term and it\'s already a single word, I can keep it as is. So c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nFor c159:\n- Role is reactants, id is c159, name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2)"", references are EGF; EGFR. The name looks like a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB2. According to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are EGFR (since EGFR is another name for ErbB1). So I can write it as ""EGF_EGFR"". The name includes all three, but since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, that\'s sufficient. So c159 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nFor c416:\n- Role is products, id is c416, name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"", references are empty. The name indicates a phosphorylated form (P) of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 complex, along with RTK_Pase. Since RTK_Pase is already mapped to c280, and the product is the active form, perhaps it\'s ""RTK_Pase_active"". Alternatively, since it\'s a phosphorylated state, maybe ""RTK_Pase_phosphorylated"". But the guidelines mention using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. So ""RTK_Pase_active"" makes sense as the active form after the reaction.\n\nWait, but the name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"". So maybe it\'s the RTK_Pase in an active state due to phosphorylation. So I think ""RTK_Pase_active"" is appropriate.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map:\nc280 to ""RTK_Pase"",\nc159 to ""EGF_EGFR"",\nc416 to ""RTK_Pase_active"".\n\nI should make sure each is a single word with underscores as needed, and use the names from the table if possible. Also, using the references, for c159, the references include EGF and EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"" is accurate. For c416, since the name is about phosphorylation, ""active"" is a state that can be appended.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and the references include ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". According to the guidelines, if the name can be interpreted as a single word, I shouldn\'t change it much. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor, and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. So, I think the term ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"" makes sense because it combines the ligand, receptor, and ATP, which is relevant in their binding.\n\nNext is c526. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh"". The references are empty here. The guidelines say if it\'s a ligand or receptor, I should connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1_h might be a specific state or form of the receptor, and Inh could stand for inhibitor or inhibited state. So, I\'m thinking ""EGF_ErbB1_h_inh"" to show that the receptor is in a inhibited state when bound to EGF.\n\nFinally, c527. The name is a complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:Inh)"". The references are empty. This seems like a reaction product where EGF is bound to ErbB1 along with ATP and in an inhibited state. So, combining all these, I\'ll make it ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_ErbB1_h_inh"". It\'s a bit long, but it accurately represents the components involved.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, using underscores to separate components. Also, I\'m considering states like ""active"" or ""bound"" if they\'re present, but in this case, ""inh"" suggests an inhibited state, which I included as ""inh"" after the receptor.\n\nI should also check if any terms can be simplified without losing biological meaning. For example, if ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" is a standard term, I might leave it as is. Since the user provided examples where they connected receptor and ligand with underscores, I\'ll follow that approach here.\n\nLastly, I\'ll structure the JSON with each id as the key and the corresponding term as the value, making sure there are no extra explanations, just the JSON object.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c10: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and the references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. The guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, use an underscore. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, EGF_L and EGFR_R. But wait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. Hmm, maybe it\'s EGF bound to EGFR with ATP? So perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest including states like ""active"" or ""bound"" as part of the term with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L_bound_to_EGFR_R or something like that. But the example given was ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps the format is ligand_L or receptor_R.\n\nWait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So it\'s ligand followed by _L or receptor followed by _R. So for c10, which is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R. But since it\'s all together, perhaps the term should reflect that. But the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. Maybe EGF_ErbB1_ATP? But that\'s three parts. Alternatively, since EGF binds to EGFR, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_L and EGFR_R, but the name is a combination. Hmm, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR since that\'s a common term.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which is the ligand, receptor, and ATP. Maybe it\'s the active form of the receptor.

So maybe EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c155: The name is ErbB2, and references are empty. Since it\'s a receptor, perhaps it\'s ErbB2_R. But wait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"", so the receptor is denoted with _R. So maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nBut the name is just ErbB2, so perhaps it\'s sufficient as ErbB2. Alternatively, if it\'s a receptor, maybe ErbB2_R.\n\nNow, c159: The name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), references include EGF and EGFR. So this is the product, which is a trimer of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe c10 can be EGF_EGFR, c155 is ErbB2, and c159 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nBut let me check the guidelines again. For c10, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 (EGFR) with ATP. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active. But the example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe for c10, it\'s EGF_L and EGFR_R, but since it\'s a combination, perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR.\n\nWait, but the id is c10, so the term should be a single word. So perhaps EGF_EGFR is acceptable.\n\nFor c155, since the name is ErbB2 and there\'s no reference, maybe it\'s ErbB2_R as it\'s a receptor.\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so it\'s a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nAlternatively, considering that ErbB1 is EGFR, it could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nBut the references for c159 include EGF and EGFR, so perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2), so maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nHmm, I think I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR for c10, ErbB2_R for c155, and EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 for c159.\n\nBut wait, in the example, the product was ""IL6_R_active"".

Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c160 + c105 => c124. There's a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c160, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3) and references are EGF; EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. Since it's a ligand bound to two receptors, I should represent this as a complex. The guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore, but here it's more of a complex. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The references column is empty, so I don't have synonyms. Since ATP is a common term, I'll just use ATP.\n\nFor c124, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP, references are EGF; EGFR. This seems similar to c160 but includes ATP. So it's the same complex as before but with ATP bound. According to guidelines, I can include states like 'bound' or 'active' with underscores. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word. For c160 and c124, the names are already multi-word but represent complexes, so using underscores makes sense. ATP is fine as is.\n\nChecking the guidelines again: if the name is an abbreviation, leave it. Since EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3 are abbreviations, it's acceptable to use them. Also, including 'bound' for the ATP makes the term more interpretable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map c160 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3, c105 to ATP, and c124 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP."", '', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

But wait, the guidelines mention if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So I think it\'s EGF as ligand and ErbB1 as receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I think it\'s part of the term. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ATP. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so maybe it\'s a ternary complex, but in terms of mapping, I need to make it a single word. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to stick with EGF_ErbB1 since ATP is a part of the reaction but not the term itself. Or perhaps I need to include it. The guidelines say to use the name column if possible. So I\'ll go with EGF_ErbB1.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, but the references include EGFR. So maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1 since ErbB1 is the receptor.\n\nNext, c503 has the name ""ErbB4:Inh"". So ErbB4 is a receptor, and Inh is an inhibitor. So perhaps it\'s ErbB4_Inh. That makes sense.\n\nThen, c505 has the name ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"". The parentheses suggest a complex, and _P might indicate phosphorylated. So maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P. The references include EGF and EGFR, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1 is part of it, but the name includes ErbB3 as well. So combining all, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P. Since the product also includes Inh, perhaps it\'s part of the term as well, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh. But I need to make it a single word, so I\'ll join with underscores: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh. But wait, the guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map from id to name, then refine. So the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"". So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh, but as a single word, I think I should combine them into EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nWait, but in the equation, c3 is EGF_ErbB1, and c503 is ErbB4_Inh. The product is a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, phosphorylated, and Inh. So perhaps the product term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n- c3: EGF_ErbB1\n- c503: ErbB4_Inh\n- c505: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh\n\nBut wait, the name for c505 is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"".

Let\'s look at the example given in the guidelines. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So the id is mapped to a term that includes the ligand and receptor.

So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ATP, but since the guidelines say to use the name column, maybe it\'s better to use EGF_ErbB1.\n\nSimilarly, c503 is ErbB4:Inh, so ErbB4_Inh.\n\nc505 is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh, but as a single word, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is a phosphorylated form, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh is another term.

So c3 is EGF_ErbB1, c503 is ErbB4_Inh, and c505 is the product, which includes EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, phosphorylated, and Inh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, which is phosphorylated, and also includes the inhibitor.

So maybe it\'s better to represent EGF_ErbB1 as EGF_EGFR, but the guidelines say to prioritize the name column. So I\'ll stick with EGF_ErbB1.\n\nAnother thought: the product name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"", so perhaps it\'s a complex where EGF is bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, which is phosphorylated, and also has an inhibitor. So the term could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh, but as a single term, perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P:Inh becomes EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh is a separate term, but since it\'s part of the name, I think it\'s better to include it as part of the term.\n\nSo the final JSON is:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c503"": ""ErbB4_Inh"",\n  ""c505"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh""\n}\n\nI think that\'s a reasonable mapping based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I see the roles are reactants, products, and modifiers. The IDs are s123, s129, and s3. The names are all EGFR and EGF. The references are the same as the names, so I don\'t need to look elsewhere for synonyms.\n\nSo, for each ID, I need to map it to its name, but considering if it\'s a receptor or ligand. EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand. So, s123 and s129 are EGFR, which is the receptor, so they should be EGFR_R. s3 is EGF, the ligand, so it should be EGF_L.\n\nBut wait, the guidelines also say that if the term is simple and interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it much. EGFR is already a standard abbreviation, so maybe I can just use EGFR without adding the ""_R"" suffix? Hmm, but the example given used R and L for receptors and ligands, so I think I should follow that.\n\nSo, s123 and s129 are both EGFR, so they become EGFR_R. s3 is EGF, so it becomes EGF_L.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term. Let me structure that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also want me to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the provided table. So, I need to look at the `id` and `name` columns to figure out the right term.\n\nIf I can identify a specific receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I have to check the replacement table to see if the receptor or ligand names are present. If they\'re not in the ""name"" column, I might need to use context or references to get it right.\n\nThere\'s also a note about a two-step process: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. So, I need to look at both the `name` and `references` columns to make accurate substitutions.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, joined by an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". But I should only do this if the term is a simple abbreviation or if it\'s reasonable as-is. If not, I shouldn\'t make significant changes.\n\nWhen the `name` and `references` have similar terms, I should prioritize the `name` for consistency. Finally, the output needs to be a JSON object with `id` as the key and the term as the value, without any extra explanations.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is c3 + c3 => c4. The replacement table has three entries. Both reactants are c3, and the product is c4. The `name` for c3 is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and the references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR.\n\nSo, for c3, the name is a complex: EGF (a ligand), ErbB1 (which is EGFR, a receptor), and ATP. Since both c3 entries are the same, their term should be the same. The product c4 is 2 times that complex.\n\nI need to create a single word for each. For c3, combining ligand and receptor: EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, it should be EGF_ErbB1. The product is two of these, so it would be EGF_ErbB1_bound because they\'re bound together.\n\nWait, but the `name` for c4 is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". So, it\'s two complexes, meaning they\'re bound. So, maybe the term for c4 is EGF_ErbB1_bound.\n\nSo, the JSON would map c3 to ""EGF_ErbB1"" and c4 to ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"".\n\nI think that\'s the right approach. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term is a single word, combining ligand and receptor with an underscore. The product includes the state ""bound"". That fits the guidelines.\n\nI should make sure I\'m not adding any extra information, just the JSON. So, the output is {""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"", ""c4"": ""EGF_ErbB1_bound""}.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c143 + c3 => c147. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. Each id needs to be mapped based on the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c143, the name is ErbB4. Since it\'s a known receptor, I can map it directly. So id ""c143"" becomes ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c3\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and the references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. The guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So combining them, I get ""EGF_L"" for the ligand part and ""EGFR_R"" for the receptor. But since the name has multiple components, maybe I need to represent both. Wait, the guidelines suggest if it\'s a simple R or L, connect with an underscore. But in this case, it\'s more complex. Perhaps it\'s better to take the most relevant part. The references include EGFR, which is the receptor, so maybe c3 is the ligand, so ""EGF_L"" makes sense.\n\nThen, c147\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4"" with references EGF and EGFR. So it\'s similar to c3 but includes ErbB4. Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a complex. Perhaps combining the ligand and receptors: ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"". That seems a bit long, but it includes all components.\n\nWait, the guidelines say each term should be a single word, so underscores are allowed. So combining all the parts into a single term with underscores is acceptable. Therefore, c147 becomes ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"".\n\nI should check if any of the names are ambiguous. ErbB4 is straightforward. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So mapping c3 as ""EGF_L"" makes sense because it\'s the ligand part of the complex.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would have c143 as ""ErbB4"", c3 as ""EGF_L"", and c147 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_ErbB4_R"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c147 + c105 => c128. Each of these ids (c147, c105, c128) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c147, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, and references are EGF; EGFR. The guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we can combine them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. So, EGF is the ligand, and the receptors are EGFR (ErbB1) and ErbB4. But in the name, it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, which probably means the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4.\n\nBut in the guidelines, when there are multiple receptors, how do we handle that? The example given was R → IL6_R, so maybe each receptor should be treated individually. But in this case, c147 is a reactant, so it\'s probably the EGF bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors. So maybe the term should be something like EGF bound to both receptors. However, the guidelines suggest using a single word. Hmm, maybe the term should be EGF bound to the receptors, but that would be multiple words. Alternatively, perhaps we can just use EGF as the ligand and the receptors as EGFR and ErbB4. But the id is c147, which corresponds to all three components.\n\nWait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4. So perhaps this represents the EGF bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors. So maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But that\'s three parts. The guidelines say to create a single word by connecting them with underscores. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the references say EGF; EGFR. So maybe EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is ErbB1. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, so perhaps the correct term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. Alternatively, since ErbB1 is EGFR, maybe it\'s better to write it as EGF_EGFR_ErbB4. But the name column uses ErbB1, so perhaps we should follow that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4, so maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4. But the guidelines suggest using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, joined with an underscore. So maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, which might imply a complex of EGF with both receptors. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9, and there are no references. The guidelines say that if the term is simple, we can leave it as is. So ATP is a standard term, so c105 would map to ATP.\n\nFor c128, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP, references are EGF; EGFR. So this is similar to c147 but with ATP added. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP. Alternatively, considering the state, maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP. But the guidelines say to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term. Since EGF is bound to the receptors, maybe we should include ""bound"" as part of the term. So perhaps EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP, so perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine using references. So for c147, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4. References are EGF; EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is EGFR. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4.\n\nBut the name uses ErbB1, so perhaps we should use that. Alternatively, since EGFR is the receptor for EGF, maybe the term is EGF_EGFR. But the name includes both ErbB1 and ErbB4, so perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR_ErbB4.\n\nBut the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency.

So c147 is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, which is the ligand-receptor complex, and c105 is ATP. So c128 is the product, which is the complex plus ATP. So perhaps c147 is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4, so the term would be EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4. Then, c105 is ATP, and c128 is the same complex plus ATP, so maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut the guidelines say to use the name column first, then refine. So for c147, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, which we can map to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But considering the state, perhaps it\'s EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nSimilarly, c128 would be EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the guidelines require including ""bound"" or if it\'s optional. The example given in the guidelines was R → IL6_R, so perhaps just combining them is sufficient. So maybe c147 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4 and c128 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut the references for c147 and c128 both include EGF; EGFR. So perhaps ErbB1 is EGFR, so the term could be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4.\n\nBut the name column uses ErbB1, so perhaps we should stick with that for consistency.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nc147: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4\nc105: ATP\nc128: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP\n\nAlternatively, considering the state, maybe:\n\nc147: EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4\nc105: ATP\nc128: EGF_bound_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP\n\nBut the guidelines don\'t specify whether to include ""bound"" unless it\'s part of the name. Since the name doesn\'t include ""bound"", perhaps it\'s not necessary. So perhaps the first option is better.\n\nWait, the equation is c147 + c105 => c128. So c147 is a reactant, which is the EGF and receptors, and c105 is ATP. So c128 is the product, which includes all of them. So perhaps c128 is the same as c147 but with ATP added. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut perhaps the term should reflect that ATP is part of the product, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_bound_ATP or something, but I\'m not sure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term is just EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4 for c147, ATP for c105, and EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP for c128.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Since both x4 and x5 involve EGF and EGFR, I\'ll map them accordingly, adding \'active\' for x5.\n\nI should also consider if the terms are already abbreviations. If so, maybe no change is needed, but in this case, combining them makes it clearer.\n\nSo, the JSON would map x4 to ""EGF_EGFR"" and x5 to ""EGF_EGFR_active"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c8 + c105 => c126. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c8, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1)_P"". The references are empty, so I\'ll focus on the name. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor, also known as EGFR. The ""_P"" probably stands for phosphorylation. So, this is likely the phosphorylated form of the EGF:EGFR complex. I\'ll map c8 to ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\n- For c105, the name is ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references. Since it\'s just ATP with a concentration, and the guideline says if it\'s interpretable as-is, leave it. So c105 is ""ATP"".\n\n- For c126, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1):ATP"" and references are EGF and EGFR. The name suggests the complex of EGF:ErbB1 with ATP. So, I\'ll map c126 to ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nI\'ll make sure each term is a single word with underscores where necessary. No need for additional changes since the names are already clear.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. Then, there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe replacement table has three rows:\n1. Role: reactants, id: EGF, name: (empty), references: EGF\n2. Role: reactants, id: EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGFR\n3. Role: products, id: L_EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGF; EGFR\n\nThe task is to map each id to a biologically interpretable term, following the guidelines.\n\nLet me go through the guidelines one by one.\n\n1. Each term must be a single word. So, no spaces, just one word each.\n\n2. Replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the replacement table. So, if the id is something like \'R\' or \'L\', I need to connect the receptor and ligand names with an underscore. For example, \'R\' becomes \'IL6_R\' and \'L\' becomes \'CSF1R_L\'.\n\n3. If it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, looking at the input, EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand. The product is L_EGFR, which seems to be a ligand-receptor complex.\n\n4. Sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name using the replacement table, then refine it using references. In this case, the replacement table doesn\'t have names filled, so I might need to rely on the references or common knowledge.\n\n5. Include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"".\n\n6. If the term is a simple abbreviation or already interpretable, don\'t change it much. So, EGF and EGFR are already known terms, so they might stay as they are.\n\n7. Prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency, but in this case, the name column is empty, so I\'ll have to rely on references or common usage.\n\n8. Output as a JSON object with id as the key and the term as the value.\n\nSo, starting with each id:\n\n- EGF: The name is empty, but the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a well-known ligand, it\'s a single word and doesn\'t need to be changed. So, map EGF to ""EGF"".\n\n- EGFR: Similarly, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So, map EGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\n- L_EGFR: The reference is both EGF and EGFR, so this is likely the ligand-receptor complex. Following the guideline, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, the complex would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the id is L_EGFR. The guidelines mention that for products, if it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, we might need to create a term like that. But in this case, the product is L_EGFR, which might be a way to denote the bound form. So perhaps it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or something similar.\n\nBut looking back, the guidelines say that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. Since the name is empty, perhaps the name is the same as the id, but the references are EGF and EGFR, so the product is the complex of EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, perhaps for L_EGFR, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines shows that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, in this case, since L_EGFR is a product, maybe it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product is a bound state, maybe it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to change it. Since L_EGFR is an id, but the name is empty, perhaps it\'s better to use the product term as the complex. But I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the equation is EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. So, L_EGFR is the product, which is likely the ligand-bound receptor. So, in biological terms, it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut according to the guidelines, the product should be a single word, so ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is three words connected by underscores, making it a single term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is just the receptor in its active or bound form, so maybe ""EGFR_active"" or ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the id is L_EGFR, which might stand for Ligand-EGFR, so perhaps the term is ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""EGF_EGFR"" for L_EGFR because it\'s the combination of the ligand and receptor, making it a single term with an underscore.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n  ""EGFR"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L_EGFR"": ""EGF_EGFR""\n}\n\nBut wait, according to the guidelines, if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it. Since EGF and EGFR are already known, they can stay as they are. L_EGFR is an id, but since the name is empty, we have to interpret it based on references, which are EGF and EGFR. So, the product is the complex of EGF and EGFR, hence ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is the active form of the receptor, so ""EGFR_active"" or ""EGFR_bound"". But I think the guidelines suggest combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore, so ""EGF_EGFR"" is better.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also want me to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the provided table. So, I need to look at the `id` and `name` columns to figure out the right term.\n\nIf I can identify a specific receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I have to check the replacement table to see if the receptor or ligand names are present. If they\'re not in the ""name"" column, I might need to use context or references to get it right.\n\nThere\'s also a note about a two-step process: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. So, I need to look at both the `name` and `references` columns to make accurate substitutions.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, joined by an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". But I should only do this if the term is a simple abbreviation or if it\'s reasonable as-is. If not, I shouldn\'t make significant changes.\n\nWhen the `name` and `references` have similar terms, I should prioritize the `name` for consistency. Finally, the output needs to be a JSON object with `id` as the key and the term as the value, without any extra explanations.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is c3 + c3 => c4. The replacement table has three entries. Both reactants are c3, and the product is c4. The `name` for c3 is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and the references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR.\n\nSo, for c3, the name is a complex: EGF (a ligand), ErbB1 (which is EGFR, a receptor), and ATP. Since both c3 entries are the same, their term should be the same. The product c4 is 2 times that complex.\n\nI need to create a single word for each. For c3, combining ligand and receptor: EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. So, it should be EGF_ErbB1. The product is two of these, so it would be EGF_ErbB1_bound because they\'re bound together.\n\nWait, but the `name` for c4 is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". So, it\'s two complexes, meaning they\'re bound. So, maybe the term for c4 is EGF_ErbB1_bound.\n\nSo, the JSON would map c3 to ""EGF_ErbB1"" and c4 to ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"".\n\nI think that\'s the right approach. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term is a single word, combining ligand and receptor with an underscore. The product includes the state ""bound"". That fits the guidelines.\n\nI should make sure I\'m not adding any extra information, just the JSON. So, the output is {""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"", ""c4"": ""EGF_ErbB1_bound""}.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included with underscores. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. The JSON should have \'id\' as the key and the term as the value, without any extra explanations.\n\nLooking at the input provided, the equation is c1 + c286 => c499. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n- c1 is EGF, with a reference to EGF.\n- c286 is ErbB1:Inh, with a reference to EGFR.\n- c499 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, with references to EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, I need to map each id to a term. Let\'s start with c1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. EGF is a well-known ligand, so I can keep it as is since it\'s a single word and already interpretable.\n\nNext is c286. The name is ErbB1:Inh, and the reference is EGFR. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor. The "":Inh"" part might stand for inhibitor, but I\'m not sure. However, the guidelines say if a term can be identified as a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should represent it as something like ""EGFR_R"". The "":Inh"" might indicate an inhibited state, so maybe ""EGFR_R_inactive"" or ""EGFR_R_bound"". But the references say EGFR, so maybe I can just use ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, c499. The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like a complex, maybe the ligand-receptor complex. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor, the complex would be EGF bound to EGFR. The "":Inh"" part might indicate that the receptor is in an inhibited state. So, combining them with an underscore and adding the state, it could be ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c1 to ""EGF"", c286 to ""EGFR_R"", and c499 to ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"". I should double-check to ensure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. For c286, I considered if it should include \'inactive\' but since the name is ErbB1:Inh, it\'s better to include the state. However, the references just say EGFR, so maybe \'EGFR_R\' is sufficient. For c499, combining the ligand and receptor with the state makes sense.\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the provided data.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c3 + c499 => c500. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c3, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references include EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n- For c499, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" with references EGF and EGFR.\n- For c500, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"" and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term in the JSON must be a single word. So, I need to convert these into single words, possibly using underscores.\n\nFor c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The guideline suggests that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor. So, combining them gives ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSimilarly, for c499, the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh. Inh might stand for inhibited or inhibitor. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_inh"".\n\nFor c500, the name is a combination of ATP and Inh. Since c500 is the product, it\'s a complex of the two. So, combining the terms from c3 and c499, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word with underscores as needed. Also, I should check if the references suggest any other terms, but in this case, EGF and EGFR are consistent across all references, so I\'ll stick with those.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- c3: EGF_EGFR\n- c499: EGF_EGFR_inh\n- c500: EGF_EGFR_ATP_inh\n\nThat should cover all the ids with biologically interpretable terms as single words.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` refers to a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and add them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. For each `id`, I should first map it to its `name` and then use the references to refine it if necessary. If the `name` is already clear, I might not need to change it. But if the `name` is an abbreviation or ambiguous, I should use the references to find a better term.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is c143 + c499 => c494.\n\nThe replacement table has:\n- c143: ErbB4\n- c499: EGF:ErbB1:Inh with references EGF; EGFR\n- c494: EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4 with references EGF; EGFR\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s go one by one.\n\nStarting with c143: The name is ErbB4, and the references don\'t provide additional info. Since ErbB4 is a known receptor tyrosine kinase, I can use it as is. So c143 maps to ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c499: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF; EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term ""Inh"" might refer to an inhibitor or maybe something else. But in this context, EGF binds to EGFR (ErbB1). So the term EGF:ErbB1:Inh could be interpreted as EGF bound to EGFR, perhaps in an inhibited state. So, to make it a single word, I can combine them as ""EGF_ErbB1"". The ""Inh"" part might indicate a state, so maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"". But the example didn\'t include states, so perhaps just ""EGF_ErbB1"" is sufficient.\n\nThen, c494: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4, with references EGF; EGFR. So this seems like a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4. Since c143 is ErbB4 and c499 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, perhaps c494 is the product of their interaction. So, combining EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4"".\n\nWait, but the references for c499 and c494 are the same, both EGF and EGFR. So maybe c499 is the EGF bound to EGFR (ErbB1), and c494 is that complex interacting with ErbB4. So, the product term should reflect that combination.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map:\n- c143: ""ErbB4""\n- c499: ""EGF_ErbB1""\n- c494: ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4""\n\nI think that\'s accurate based on the guidelines. Each term is a single word, using the names from the table, combining receptor and ligand where appropriate. I don\'t see a need for states here since the example didn\'t include them, and the references didn\'t specify any. So this should be the correct mapping.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c10 + c156 => c161. So, c10 and c156 are reactants, and c161 is the product.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each id has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s go step by step for each id.\n\nStarting with c10: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and the references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is unless it can be more specific. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, ErbB1 is a receptor, and ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate. But since the name already combines them with colons, maybe it\'s better to use the more interpretable form. But the guideline says if it\'s reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much. So maybe c10 can stay as EGF_ErbB1_ATP or just EGF:ErbB1:ATP? Wait, the guideline suggests using underscores if possible, but the name is already a combination. Hmm, perhaps it\'s better to keep it as EGF_ErbB1_ATP since it\'s a single word connected by underscores. Alternatively, maybe the term is already clear, so just EGF:ErbB1:ATP? Wait, the guideline says each term must be a single word, so colons might not be allowed. So I think I need to convert it into a single word with underscores. So EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nNext, c156: The name is ""ErbB4"" and references are empty. So it\'s just ErbB4. Since it\'s a single word and already a known receptor, I can leave it as ErbB4.\n\nNow, c161: The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4)"" and references are EGF and EGFR. The parentheses might indicate a complex. So this is a product formed by EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4. Since the guidelines suggest using underscores, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. Alternatively, considering the product, perhaps it\'s a dimer or a complex, but since the name is in parentheses, I think just converting the components with underscores is sufficient. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nWait, but in the output example, c10 was mapped to EGF_ErbB1_ATP, c156 to ErbB4, and c161 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. That makes sense. Each id is converted into a single word with underscores where necessary.\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, use underscores for combining receptor and ligand, and if there\'s a state, include it with an underscore.

The guidelines say that if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, I can combine them with an underscore. So EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. But in the name, it\'s listed as EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, which seems like a complex of the ligand and two receptors. So maybe I can create a single term by combining them. Perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9, but the references are empty. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple term, don\'t change it.

So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_ATP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, using underscores to connect parts. Since the guidelines allow for states like active or bound, but in this case, there\'s no such indication, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nLet me structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each id maps to the combined term without any additional changes unless necessary. I think this should satisfy the requirements.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Since RTK_Pase is a known term and it\'s already a single word, I can keep it as is. So c280 maps to ""RTK_Pase"".\n\nFor c159:\n- Role is reactants, id is c159, name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2)"", references are EGF; EGFR. The name looks like a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB2. According to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are EGFR (since EGFR is another name for ErbB1). So I can write it as ""EGF_EGFR"". The name includes all three, but since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, that\'s sufficient. So c159 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nFor c416:\n- Role is products, id is c416, name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"", references are empty. The name indicates a phosphorylated form (P) of the ErbB1 and ErbB2 complex, along with RTK_Pase. Since RTK_Pase is already mapped to c280, and the product is the active form, perhaps it\'s ""RTK_Pase_active"". Alternatively, since it\'s a phosphorylated state, maybe ""RTK_Pase_phosphorylated"". But the guidelines mention using states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. So ""RTK_Pase_active"" makes sense as the active form after the reaction.\n\nWait, but the name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P:RTK_Pase"". So maybe it\'s the RTK_Pase in an active state due to phosphorylation.

The guidelines say to use context, so maybe just EGF_ErbB1.\n\n- For c502, the name is ""ErbB2:Inh"" and no references. Since it\'s a receptor and inhibitor, maybe ErbB2 is a receptor, so maybe ErbB2_Receptor, but the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, use the specific term. The name is ""ErbB2:Inh"", so perhaps the term is Inh. But I\'m not sure. Wait, the id c502 is a reactant, so maybe it\'s an inhibitor of ErbB2. So perhaps the term should be something like ErbB2_inhibitor, but the name is ""ErbB2:Inh"". So maybe just ""ErbB2:Inh"" isn\'t the right approach. Alternatively, since Inh is a suffix, maybe the term is ""Inh"". But the guidelines say to use the name column first, so maybe c502 should be ""ErbB2:Inh"". But that\'s two words. The guidelines say each term must be a single word. Hmm, perhaps I should parse ""ErbB2:Inh"" into two parts. Wait, the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So ""ErbB2:Inh"" might be an inhibitor of ErbB2. So perhaps the term is ""ErbB2_inh"". Alternatively, maybe it\'s just ""Inh"" as the term, but I\'m not sure. Wait, the name is ""ErbB2:Inh"", which is two parts, but the id is c502. I\'m a bit confused here. Maybe I should look at the references for c3 which include EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So perhaps c3 is EGF_ErbB1. Then c502 is an inhibitor, so maybe it\'s Inh. But I\'m not sure.\n\n- For c504, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh"" and references include EGF and EGFR. So this is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and an inhibitor. The guidelines say to consider states like bound or active, so maybe it\'s the active form. But the name includes Inh, so maybe it\'s the inhibited form. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh. Or, since it\'s a complex, maybe it\'s a ternary complex with the inhibitor. So combining all, it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh. But that\'s four parts. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s a dimer of ErbB1 and ErbB2 bound to EGF and inhibited. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inhibited. But I\'m not sure.\n\nWait, maybe I should break it down step by step. For each id, I need to map it to a single word term based on the name and references, using the guidelines.\n\nc3: name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"". Since EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is a component. But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column. So maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1. Because the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", but the references include EGF and EGFR (which is ErbB1). So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1. The ATP is part of the process but not the term.\n\nc502: name is ""ErbB2:Inh"". Since it\'s a receptor and an inhibitor, perhaps the term is ErbB2_inh. Or maybe it\'s an inhibitor of ErbB2, so the term is Inh. But the guidelines say if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, use the specific term. So perhaps ""Inh"" is the term, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since it\'s ErbB2 with Inh, maybe it\'s ErbB2_inh.\n\nc504: name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh"". So it\'s a complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and Inh. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh. Or considering the state, maybe it\'s the active or bound state. Since Inh is present, maybe it\'s the inhibited state. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inhibited. But the guidelines say to use underscores, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine using references. So for c3, id is c3, name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. The references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, EGFR is the receptor (ErbB1). So the term would be EGF_ErbB1. Because the name includes EGF and ErbB1, and the references confirm that.\n\nFor c502, name is ErbB2:Inh. The references are empty. So perhaps it\'s an inhibitor of ErbB2, so the term would be ErbB2_inh. Or just Inh, but I think the term should be specific, so ErbB2_inh.\n\nFor c504, name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh. References are EGF and EGFR. So it\'s a complex of EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB2, and Inh. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nc3: EGF_ErbB1\n\nc502: ErbB2_inh\n\nc504: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh\n\nWait, but the name for c504 is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):Inh"", which could imply that the complex is inhibited. So maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_inh.\n\nI think that\'s it.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c159 + c105 => c123. Each of these ids (c159, c105, c123) is listed in the replacement table with their names and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2) and references are EGF; EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since the guidelines suggest using receptor and ligand names, perhaps I should combine them. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""? But wait, the example given in the guidelines uses an underscore, like IL6_R or CSF1R_L. Hmm, but in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_ligand with receptors. But the example shows R and L as suffixes, so maybe EGF as L and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as R. Wait, but the name is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps the term should represent the complex. Since it\'s a complex, maybe just using the components. But the guidelines say to use single words. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" is acceptable.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP with a value 1.2e9, but the references are empty. So it\'s just ATP, which is a molecule. Since it\'s a standard term, we can leave it as ATP.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and references are EGF; EGFR. So this is the product after ATP binds to the complex. So perhaps it\'s the ATP-bound form. The guidelines suggest including states like bound or active. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound""? But the name already includes ATP, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as the complex with ATP. Alternatively, since ATP is a ligand, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP. But the guidelines say if it\'s a ligand, use an underscore, so perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, the example was R and L as suffixes. But in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So maybe c159 should be EGF (ligand) and the receptors as ErbB1 and ErbB2. But the name is a complex, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as EGF bound to the receptors. But the term needs to be a single word. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" for c159, ""ATP"" for c105, and ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" for c123.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output was ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps for c159, since it\'s the ligand and receptors, it\'s EGF (ligand) and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as receptors. But how to represent that in a single word? Maybe ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB2_R""? But that\'s a bit long and might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" as a complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the complex is the receptor dimer, so ErbB1 and ErbB2 form a heterodimer bound to EGF. So the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_receptor_complex"" but that\'s more than a single word. Hmm, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. So perhaps we can combine them with underscores without the word \'receptor\' or \'ligand\' unless necessary.\n\nWait, in the example, the output for c159 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" and for c123 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"". So perhaps that\'s the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n{\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c123"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about c123. Should it be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound_ATP"" or just include ATP as part of the complex? The guidelines mention including states like bound, so maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" would be better. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, so it\'s the complex with ATP. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" to indicate the state. But the guidelines say to use the name column as priority, so since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, maybe it\'s better to include ATP as part of the term without adding \'bound\' unless necessary.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct. So the JSON would be as above.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: the equation is c1 + c2 => c3, and the replacement table has three entries.\n\nFor c1, the id is \'c1\', the name is \'EGF\', and the reference is \'EGF\'. EGF is a known ligand, so I should represent it as a single word. Since it\'s a ligand, maybe it should be \'EGF_L\'. But the guidelines say if it\'s simple, don\'t change it. So perhaps just \'EGF\' is okay, but since it\'s a ligand, maybe the \'L\' suffix is better. I\'ll go with \'EGF_L\'.\n\nNext, c2 is \'ErbB1:ATP\' with references \'ATP; EGFR\'. ErbB1 is the same as EGFR, the epidermal growth factor receptor. So this is the receptor part. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe I should represent it as \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s more than a single word. Wait, the guidelines say each term should be a single word, so maybe I need to combine them. Alternatively, since the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', perhaps it\'s better to keep it as \'ErbB1_ATP\' but that\'s two words. Hmm, maybe \'EGFR_ATP\' since EGFR is the more common term. But I\'m supposed to use the \'name\' column if possible. The name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', so maybe \'ErbB1_ATP\' as a single term.\n\nFor c3, the id is \'c3\', the name is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\', and the references are \'EGF; ATP; EGFR\'. This seems like the complex formed when EGF binds to EGFR, which is ErbB1, and also involves ATP. So, perhaps this is the active state of the receptor. Maybe I should represent it as \'EGFR_R_active\' since it\'s bound to EGF and ATP, indicating activity. But I\'m not sure if \'ATP\' is part of the active state term. Alternatively, since the name includes EGF, ErbB1, and ATP, maybe \'EGFR_EGF_ATP\' but that\'s three words. Alternatively, since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s the active form, so \'EGFR_R_active\' makes sense.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So for c2, which is the receptor, I should have \'EGFR_R\' and maybe include the state if applicable. But since c2 is ErbB1:ATP, perhaps it\'s the receptor in a state involving ATP, so maybe \'EGFR_R_ATP\'? But that\'s more than one word. Alternatively, maybe just \'EGFR_R\' since the presence of ATP is part of the process but not part of the term.\n\nWait, the references for c2 include ATP and EGFR, so maybe \'EGFR_R\' is sufficient. But the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', so perhaps I should represent it as \'EGFR_ATP\' but as a single term. Hmm, perhaps \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s three words. I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nLet me try to approach this systematically. Each id (c1, c2, c3) needs a single word term. \n\nc1: EGF is a ligand, so \'EGF_L\' or just \'EGF\' if it\'s simple. The guidelines say to use the name if possible, so \'EGF\' might be acceptable, but adding \'_L\' makes it clearer as a ligand.\n\nc2: \'ErbB1:ATP\' – since ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR), and it\'s bound to ATP, maybe the term is \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s three words. Alternatively, since it\'s a receptor, \'EGFR_R\' and the ATP is part of the context. But the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', so perhaps \'ErbB1_ATP\' as a single term. But I think the receptor is EGFR, so \'EGFR_R\' is better.\n\nc3: The product is \'EGF:ErbB1:ATP\', which is the complex. So perhaps it\'s the active form of the receptor when bound to EGF and ATP. So maybe \'EGFR_R_active\' as a single term.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map from id to name, then refine using references. So for c2, the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', and the references include \'ATP; EGFR\'. So maybe the accurate term is \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' but that\'s too long. Alternatively, \'EGFR_ATP\' as a single term. But I\'m not sure if that\'s standard. Maybe \'EGFR_bound_ATP\' but that\'s two words. Alternatively, perhaps \'EGFR_R\' is sufficient, as the ATP is part of the process but not part of the term.\n\nI think I\'m overcomplicating this. Let me try to follow the guidelines again. Each term must be a single word. For c2, the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', which is a receptor (EGFR) bound to ATP. So perhaps \'EGFR_R_bound\' but that\'s two words. Alternatively, \'EGFR_bound\' as a single term, but that might not capture the receptor part. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is \'ErbB1:ATP\', and references include \'EGFR\', perhaps the term is \'EGFR_ATP\' as a single word, combining the receptor with the ligand or state. But I\'m not sure if that\'s standard. Maybe \'EGFR_R\' is better, and the ATP is part of the context.\n\nWait, the user\'s example was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"". So for a receptor, we add \'_R\', and for a ligand, \'_L\'. So for c1, which is a ligand (EGF), it should be \'EGF_L\'. For c2, which is a receptor (ErbB1/EGFR), it should be \'EGFR_R\'. The presence of ATP might indicate the state, but since the term needs to be a single word, perhaps we include it as a suffix. So \'EGFR_R_bound_ATP\' is three words, which isn\'t allowed. Alternatively, maybe just \'EGFR_R\' since the ATP is part of the process but not the term.\n\nBut the user\'s example shows that sometimes a state can be included with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". So perhaps for c2, since it\'s bound to ATP, the term could be \'EGFR_R_bound\' but that\'s two words. Alternatively, \'EGFR_bound\' but that doesn\'t include the receptor part. Hmm.\n\nI think I\'ll go with \'EGFR_R\' for c2, as it\'s the receptor, and the ATP is part of the process but not part of the term. For c3, which is the product, it\'s the active form, so \'EGFR_R_active\'.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\nc1: \'EGF_L\'\n\nc2: \'EGFR_R\'\n\nc3: \'EGFR_R_active\'\n\nWait, but in the user\'s example, the product in the equation is c3, which is the result of c1 + c2. So in this case, EGF (c1) binds to EGFR (c2), forming the active receptor complex (c3). So perhaps c3 is the active form, hence \'EGFR_R_active\'.\n\nBut the references for c3 include \'EGF; ATP; EGFR\', so it\'s a combination of all three. But since the term must be a single word, I think \'EGFR_R_active\' is the best fit.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c1"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""c2"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""c3"": ""EGFR_R_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the most accurate based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I also need to consider if more context is needed, like states such as ""bound"" or ""active"". \n\nThe user mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name` using the table, then refine it using references. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency. If the term is already an abbreviation and clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is Rc00UU + L => RcL00UU; Rc00UU, L. The replacement table has rows with role, id, name, and references. For reactants, Rc00UU maps to Rc00UU with a reference to EGFR. L maps to L with a reference to EGF. The products row for RcL00UU doesn\'t have a reference, and modifiers have the same mappings as reactants.\n\nSo, I need to map each id: Rc00UU, L, RcL00UU. From the replacement table, Rc00UU is associated with EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I can represent it as EGFR_R. L is associated with EGF, a ligand, so that would be EGF_L. For RcL00UU, which is a product, it\'s the complex of Rc00UU and L, so combining EGFR and EGF, it should be EGFR_EGF. Since it\'s the bound state, I\'ll add ""_bound"" to make it EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, connected by underscores.

I think this refers to a complex of EGF, ErbB1 (which is the EGFR), and ATP. Since it\'s a complex, maybe it\'s the receptor-ligand-ATP trimer? So perhaps it\'s ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"". But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"", but I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"".\n\nFor c105, the name is ""ATP 1.2e9"".

So maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"".\n\nWait, but in the example, the product in the output was ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"". So I think that\'s correct.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""c4"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c116"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s how it should be mapped based on the guidelines and the given replacement table.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Each id needs to be mapped based on the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c143, the name is ErbB4. Since it\'s a known receptor, I can map it directly. So id ""c143"" becomes ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c3\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and the references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. The guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So combining them, I get ""EGF_L"" for the ligand part and ""EGFR_R"" for the receptor. But since the name has multiple components, maybe I need to represent both. Wait, the guidelines suggest if it\'s a simple R or L, connect with an underscore. But in this case, it\'s more complex. Perhaps it\'s better to take the most relevant part. The references include EGFR, which is the receptor, so maybe c3 is the ligand, so ""EGF_L"" makes sense.\n\nThen, c147\'s name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4"" with references EGF and EGFR.

The role is reactants. For c86, the name is R_degraded, with no references provided, and the role is products.\n\nStarting with c161: The name is a complex of EGF with ErbB1 and ErbF4. ErbB1 is also known as EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor. Therefore, the term should be EGF_L_ErbB1_R. That combines the ligand and receptor with their respective suffixes.\n\nFor c86, the name is R_degraded. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the degraded form of the receptor. So, I should keep it as R_degraded, but ensure it\'s a single term. It\'s already a single term, so that should be fine.\n\nI need to make sure each id maps correctly. So, c161 becomes ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R"" and c86 becomes ""R_degraded"".\n\nI\'ll structure this into a JSON object, with the ids as keys and the terms as values. No explanations or extra info, just the JSON.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c162, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB2)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it's a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB2. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB2_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the references are empty. The guidelines mention that if a term is simple or reasonably interpretable, we don't change it much. So ATP is a standard term, so I can just use ATP.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and the references are EGF and EGFR. The role is product. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So, the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB2, along with ATP. Since it's a product, it might be the active form. So, the term could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines suggest that if states like active or bound are present, they should be included. So, perhaps the term should reflect that the complex is active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have each id as a key with the corresponding term as the value."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the guidelines and the input data provided.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table, there are three entries:\n\n1. species_25 is EGF, with the reference also being EGF.\n2. species_1 is freeEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n3. species_0 is boundEGFReceptor, with the reference EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term should be a single word, and if possible, receptors and ligands should be connected with an underscore. Also, if there are states like bound or active, they should be included with an underscore.\n\nStarting with species_25: the name is EGF, which is already a single word and a well-known ligand. There\'s no need to change it, so it maps directly to ""EGF"".\n\nNext, species_1 is freeEGFReceptor. The name is already descriptive, but according to the guidelines, if we can identify a specific receptor or ligand, we should use an underscore. The reference for this is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, freeEGFReceptor can be simplified to ""EGFR"" because it\'s the receptor for EGF. Since it\'s the receptor, we don\'t need the ""Receptor"" part; just ""EGFR"" suffices.\n\nThen, species_0 is boundEGFReceptor. Again, the reference is EGFR. Since this is the bound state, we can include ""bound"" as part of the term. So, following the guideline, we would combine the receptor name with the state: ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nWait, but looking back, the guidelines mention that if the name is already simple and interpretable, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. However, in this case, species_1 and species_0 both have the same reference, EGFR. So, perhaps species_1 is the free form and species_0 is the bound form. Therefore, mapping species_1 to ""EGFR"" and species_0 to ""EGFR_bound"" makes sense.\n\nI should also consider if there\'s any ambiguity. The name for species_1 is ""freeEGFReceptor,"" which clearly indicates it\'s the free form of the receptor. The name for species_0 is ""boundEGFReceptor,"" indicating it\'s the bound form. So, using ""EGFR"" for the free form and ""EGFR_bound"" for the bound form accurately reflects their states.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach. So, the JSON would map species_25 to ""EGF"", species_1 to ""EGFR"", and species_0 to ""EGFR_bound"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. If I come across terms like ""R"" or ""L"", which stand for receptor and ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I have to be careful because sometimes the receptor or ligand names aren\'t in the ""name"" column. I need to use context and references to figure them out accurately.\n\nAnother point is that sometimes a two-step process is needed. I might first map the `id` to the `name` using the table and then refine it further using the references for better biological accuracy. For example, if an `id` maps to a general term, the references might provide a more specific term.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, connected with an underscore. So, if a protein is in a bound state, I would name it like ""IL6_R_active"" instead of just ""IL6_R"".\n\nIf the term is already a simple abbreviation or is easily understandable as is, I shouldn\'t change it much. It\'s about balance—making it interpretable without overcomplicating it.\n\nThe user also mentioned that if the `name` and `reference` columns have similar terms or synonyms, I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency and clarity. That makes sense because the `name` is likely the primary term they want to use.\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided. The equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each `id`:\n\n1. **bEGFR**: The role is reactants and products. The name is boundEGFR, and the references mention EGFR and EGF. Since the name is already ""boundEGFR"", which is a single word, I don\'t need to change it. It\'s clear that this refers to the bound form of the epidermal growth factor receptor.\n\n2. **PI3K**: The role is reactant. The name is PI3K, and the references point to a MIRIAM identifier. The name is straightforward, so I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"".\n\n3. **bEGFR (products)**: Same as the reactant, so it\'s ""boundEGFR"".\n\n4. **pPI3K**: The role is product. The name is pPI3K, and the references include another MIRIAM identifier. The name is already a single word, indicating the phosphorylated form of PI3K. So, I\'ll use ""pPI3K"".\n\nI need to make sure that each `id` maps correctly. The output should be a JSON object where each key is the `id` and the value is the corresponding term. So, the JSON should look like:\n\n{\n  ""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""pPI3K"": ""pPI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s all. I don\'t see any need for further changes since each term is already a single word and interpretable as is. The references don\'t suggest any alternative terms that are more accurate in this context. So, I\'ll proceed with this JSON.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is species_25 + species_1 => species_0. So, we\'re dealing with three species here: 25, 1, and 0.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- species_25 is mapped to EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is also EGF. Since EGF is already a well-known ligand, I don\'t need to change it. So, species_25 should just be EGF.\n\n- species_1 is mapped to free_EGFR, but the reference is EGFR. The name is \'free_EGFR\', which suggests it\'s the free form of the receptor. According to the guidelines, if the term is a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. But since \'free_EGFR\' is more specific, indicating it\'s the unbound form, I should use that. So, species_1 becomes free_EGFR.\n\n- species_0 is mapped to pEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The name is \'pEGFR\', which stands for phosphorylated EGFR. This is a specific state of the receptor, so I should keep it as pEGFR.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word and use underscores where necessary. For example, \'free_EGFR\' is a single term connected by an underscore. Similarly, \'pEGFR\' is already a single term.\n\nI don\'t see any ambiguity here, so no further refinements are needed. Each id maps directly to its name without requiring additional context from the references beyond what\'s provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have species_25 as ""EGF"", species_1 as ""free_EGFR"", and species_0 as ""pEGFR"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is species_0 => species_25 + species_1, which probably represents a chemical reaction where species_0 is converted into species_25 and species_1.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries:\n- species_0: role is reactant, name is pEGFR, reference is EGFR.\n- species_25: role is product, name is EGF, reference is EGF.\n- species_1: role is product, name is free_EGFR, reference is EGFR.\n\nMy task is to map each id to a biologically accurate term.\n\nStarting with species_0: The name is pEGFR, which likely stands for phosphorylated EGFR. The reference is just EGFR, so maybe I should use the phosphorylated form since that\'s more specific. So, I\'ll map species_0 to ""EGFR phosphorylated"" but as a single word: ""EGFR_phosphorylated"".\n\nNext, species_25: The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s already a single word and well-known, I don\'t need to change it. So species_25 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nFor species_1: The name is free_EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The term ""free"" indicates that the receptor is not bound. To make it a single word, I\'ll use ""EGFR_free"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. In this case, EGFR is a receptor, so maybe I should include ""R"" for receptor. So species_0 could be ""EGFR_R_phosphorylated"" and species_1 as ""EGFR_R_free"". But the guidelines also say to use the name column if possible. The name for species_0 is pEGFR, which is phosphorylated, so maybe keeping it as ""EGFR_phosphorylated"" is better. Similarly, species_1\'s name is ""free_EGFR"", so ""EGFR_free"" seems appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word. So I\'ll use underscores to join the parts.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term:\n- species_0: ""EGFR_phosphorylated""\n- species_25: ""EGF""\n- species_1: ""EGFR_free""\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines. Each term is a single word, uses the name where possible, and includes the state if necessary. I don\'t see any ambiguity that needs resolving beyond what\'s provided.', '', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: Rp + PI3K => Rp_PI3K. The replacement table has three rows. The first two are reactants, Rp and PI3K, and the product is Rp_PI3K.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, Rp\'s name is blank, but the references mention EGF and EGFR. So, Rp must be referring to the receptor. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, Rp should map to EGFR. So, Rp becomes ""EGFR"".\n\nPI3K\'s name is empty, but it\'s a known enzyme in biology, so I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"" since it\'s a standard abbreviation and doesn\'t need further interpretation.\n\nThe product is Rp_PI3K, which, after replacing Rp with EGFR, becomes ""EGFR_PI3K"". Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a complex, so the underscore makes sense here.\n\nI need to make sure I don\'t add any extra information beyond the JSON. Each key is the \'id\', and the value is the term. So, the JSON should look like:\n\n{\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""Rp_PI3K"": ""EGFR_PI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check to make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to use the \'name\' column if possible, but since Rp\'s name is blank, I used the reference. PI3K is straightforward. The product combines both. Yep, that should do it.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. Then, there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe replacement table has three rows:\n1. Role: reactants, id: EGF, name: (empty), references: EGF\n2. Role: reactants, id: EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGFR\n3. Role: products, id: L_EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGF; EGFR\n\nThe task is to map each id to a biologically interpretable term, following the guidelines.\n\nLet me go through the guidelines one by one.\n\n1. Each term must be a single word. So, no spaces, just one word each.\n\n2. Replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the replacement table. So, if the id is something like \'R\' or \'L\', I need to connect the receptor and ligand names with an underscore. For example, \'R\' becomes \'IL6_R\' and \'L\' becomes \'CSF1R_L\'.\n\n3. If it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, looking at the input, EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand. The product is L_EGFR, which seems to be a ligand-receptor complex.\n\n4. Sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name using the replacement table, then refine it using references. In this case, the replacement table doesn\'t have names filled, so I might need to rely on the references or common knowledge.\n\n5. Include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"".\n\n6. If the term is a simple abbreviation or already interpretable, don\'t change it much. So, EGF and EGFR are already known terms, so they might stay as they are.\n\n7. Prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency, but in this case, the name column is empty, so I\'ll have to rely on references or common usage.\n\n8. Output as a JSON object with id as the key and the term as the value.\n\nSo, starting with each id:\n\n- EGF: The name is empty, but the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a well-known ligand, it\'s a single word and doesn\'t need to be changed. So, map EGF to ""EGF"".\n\n- EGFR: Similarly, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So, map EGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\n- L_EGFR: The reference is both EGF and EGFR, so this is likely the ligand-receptor complex. Following the guideline, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, the complex would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the id is L_EGFR. The guidelines mention that for products, if it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, we might need to create a term like that. But in this case, the product is L_EGFR, which might be a way to denote the bound form. So perhaps it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or something similar.\n\nBut looking back, the guidelines say that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. Since the name is empty, perhaps the name is the same as the id, but the references are EGF and EGFR, so the product is the complex of EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, perhaps for L_EGFR, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines shows that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, in this case, since L_EGFR is a product, maybe it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product is a bound state, maybe it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to change it. Since L_EGFR is an id, but the name is empty, perhaps it\'s better to use the product term as the complex. But I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the equation is EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. So, L_EGFR is the product, which is likely the ligand-bound receptor. So, in biological terms, it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut according to the guidelines, the product should be a single word, so ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is three words connected by underscores, making it a single term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is just the receptor in its active or bound form, so maybe ""EGFR_active"" or ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the id is L_EGFR, which might stand for Ligand-EGFR, so perhaps the term is ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""EGF_EGFR"" for L_EGFR because it\'s the combination of the ligand and receptor, making it a single term with an underscore.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n  ""EGFR"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L_EGFR"": ""EGF_EGFR""\n}\n\nBut wait, according to the guidelines, if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it. Since EGF and EGFR are already known, they can stay as they are. L_EGFR is an id, but since the name is empty, we have to interpret it based on references, which are EGF and EGFR. So, the product is the complex of EGF and EGFR, hence ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is the active form of the receptor, so ""EGFR_active"" or ""EGFR_bound"". But I think the guidelines suggest combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore, so ""EGF_EGFR"" is better.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

Products: L, name is L, reference is EGF.\n4. Modifiers: RcL00UU, same as the first entry.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically meaningful term. Starting with RcL00UU. The `name` is the same as the `id`, and there\'s no reference. So maybe it\'s a complex or a receptor-ligand pair. Since the products are Rc00UU (EGFR) and L (EGF), I can infer that RcL00UU is the bound state of EGFR and EGF. So the term should be EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nNext, Rc00UU has the name Rc00UU and reference EGFR. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the receptor alone, so EGFR.\n\nLastly, L is mapped to EGF, so the term is EGF.\n\nI think that covers all the `id`s in the replacement table.

But each term should be a single word, so combining them with underscores. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nLet me check the guidelines again.

Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, maybe I should combine them into a single term. The format is ligand_receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. But wait, the guidelines mention if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So I think it\'s EGF as ligand and ErbB1 as receptor, so EGF_ErbB1. ATP is mentioned, but it\'s part of the name, so I\'m not sure if I should include it. The guidelines say to use context, so maybe just EGF_ErbB1.\n\n- For c506, the name is ""ErbB3:Inh"" and no references. Since it\'s a reactant, and the name has Inh, which probably stands for inhibitor. So maybe it\'s an inhibitor of ErbB3. But how to represent this? The guidelines say to include states like bound or active, but Inh isn\'t exactly a state. Alternatively, it could be ErbB3 bound by an inhibitor. Maybe ErbB3_Inh.\n\n- For c507, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh"" and references EGF, EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. The _P might indicate phosphorylation. So the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3, phosphorylated. Then there\'s :Inh, which might be an inhibitor. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and maybe with Inh? Or perhaps it\'s part of the product, so maybe the complex is active, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_active. But the name also has :Inh, so maybe the product includes the inhibitor. Alternatively, the product is the complex with the inhibitor, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. So for c3, name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. References include EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So maybe EGF_ErbB1.\n\nFor c506, name is ErbB3:Inh, no references. So perhaps it\'s ErbB3 inhibited, so ErbB3_inhibited or ErbB3_Inh.\n\nFor c507, name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh. So the complex is EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB3, phosphorylated, and with an inhibitor. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh. But how to format that. Guidelines say to use underscores for states. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the inhibitor is a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product, it\'s part of the term. So the JSON would map each id to their respective terms.\n\nSo putting it together:\n\nc3: EGF_ErbB1\n\nc506: ErbB3_Inh\n\nc507: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P\n\nWait, but the name for c507 has Inh, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if Inh is a state or a separate entity. Since it\'s part of the product, maybe it\'s part of the complex. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe the Inh is just part of the product term, so include it as is. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but c507\'s name includes :Inh, so perhaps it\'s part of the product term. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh. But how to represent that. Maybe as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, since the references for c507 include EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1, so maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P, and the Inh is a separate part, but since it\'s part of the product, perhaps it\'s included as a state. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a suffix.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if Inh is a state or a separate entity. If it\'s a state, then maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh. If it\'s a separate entity, maybe it\'s part of the complex. But in the JSON, each id maps to a single term, so perhaps c507 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P.\n\nWait, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh. So the complex is phosphorylated and has an inhibitor. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with the inhibitor. But how to format that. Maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, the Inh might be a separate part, but in the JSON, each id is mapped individually. So c507 is the product, which includes the complex and the inhibitor. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P and Inh, but since it\'s a single term, maybe combine them as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but c507\'s name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the Inh is a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product, it\'s part of the term. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s the correct approach. Maybe I should focus on the name and references. For c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, but the references include EGFR, which is ErbB1. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1. For c506, it\'s ErbB3:Inh, so maybe ErbB3_Inh. For c507, it\'s (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3)_P:Inh, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P, and the Inh might be part of the product, but perhaps it\'s a separate entity, but since it\'s part of the product term, maybe it\'s included as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the Inh is an inhibitor of the complex, so the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P with Inh as a state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nWait, but the name for c507 includes Inh, so maybe I should include it. So perhaps c507 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P_Inh.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe it\'s better to include it as part of the term. So the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c506"": ""ErbB3_Inh"",\n  ""c507"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_P""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best approach based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c147 + c105 => c128. Each of these ids (c147, c105, c128) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c147, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, and references are EGF; EGFR. The guidelines say that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we can combine them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. So, EGF is the ligand, and the receptors are EGFR (ErbB1) and ErbB4. But in the name, it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, which probably means the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4.\n\nBut in the guidelines, when there are multiple receptors, how do we handle that? The example given was R → IL6_R, so maybe for multiple receptors, we can list them as ErbB1_R and ErbB4_R. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, so perhaps the term should include the ligand and both receptors. Hmm, but the guidelines say to make a single word by connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore. So maybe the term should be something like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nWait, but the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, so perhaps the term is already a combination. But the id is c147, and we need to map it to a single word. So, perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nWait, but the references say EGF; EGFR. So EGFR is the receptor for EGF. So maybe the ligand is EGF, and the receptor is EGFR. But in the name, it\'s ErbB1 and ErbB4. Wait, ErbB1 is the same as EGFR. So, perhaps the name is EGF with ErbB1 (EGFR) and ErbB4 receptors. So, perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nAlternatively, since EGFR is the same as ErbB1, maybe the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4. But I\'m not sure if that\'s necessary.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9, and references are empty. The id is c105. The name is ""ATP 1.2e9"". Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, the guidelines say not to make significant changes. So the term would just be ATP.\n\nFor c128, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP, references are EGF; EGFR. So similar to c147, but with ATP. So, perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nWait, but in the equation, c128 is the product of c147 and c105. So, c147 is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, and c105 is ATP. So the product is the combination of both, hence EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. But in this case, the name is already a combination, so perhaps we just join them with underscores. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to make a single word by connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore. So in the case of c147, it\'s a ligand and receptors. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nBut maybe it\'s better to separate the ligand and receptor as per the example. For example, R becomes IL6_R. So perhaps for c147, the ligand is EGF, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_R_ErbB4_R. But that seems a bit long.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4, combining ligand and receptors without the R suffix.\n\nWait, the example given in the guidelines was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"". So when the role is R or L, we add R or L as a suffix. But in our case, the role is reactants, so perhaps the term is just the combination of ligand and receptors.\n\nSo for c147, which is a reactant, the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nFor c105, it\'s ATP, so just ATP.\n\nFor c128, the product, it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nWait, but in the references for c147 and c128, it\'s EGF; EGFR. So maybe the receptors are EGFR and ErbB4. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ErbB4.\n\nBut in the name, it\'s ErbB1 and ErbB4. So perhaps it\'s better to use the names from the name column rather than the references. The guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency.\n\nSo, c147: EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4 → EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4.\n\nc105: ATP 1.2e9 → ATP.\n\nc128: EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP → EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nBut wait, in the guidelines, it says that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map from id to name, then refine using references. So for c147, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4, and the references are EGF; EGFR. So perhaps the name should be refined to EGF_EGFR, since EGFR is the same as ErbB1. But the name column says ErbB1, so maybe we should use that.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4, as per the name column.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go, following the guidelines to prioritize the name column.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c147"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c128"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP""\n}\n\nWait, but the equation is c147 + c105 => c128. So c128 is the product, which combines EGF, ErbB1, ErbB4, and ATP. So the term for c128 would include all four components.\n\nBut perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_bound or something, but the guidelines say to include states like bound or active with an underscore. But in this case, it\'s just a combination, so perhaps just adding ATP as part of the term.\n\nSo, the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c147"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c128"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP""\n}\n\nI think that makes sense. Each id is mapped to a single word combining the components from the name column, using underscores.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c148 + c105 => c122. There are three ids here: c148, c105, and c122. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c148. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB2 is HER2. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be something like ""EGFR:HER2_phosphorylated"". I\'ll use underscores to combine them as per the guidelines.\n\nNext, c105. The name is ""ATP  1.2e9"". Hmm, ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate, a common molecule. The number might be a concentration, but since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"".\n\nThen, c122. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2:ATP"" and references include EGF and EGFR. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the term can be simplified. So, it\'s ""EGF:EGFR:HER2:ATP"".\n\nWait, I should check if there are any states like bound or active. The c148 has _P, which I interpreted as phosphorylated. But the guidelines mention using states like ""bound"" or ""active"". Maybe ""phosphorylated"" is acceptable as a state. So I think I\'m okay there.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. Let me structure that.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c150 + c105 => c128. Each of these ids (c150, c105, c128) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c150, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB4. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB4_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the name is simply ATP. The references are empty. Since ATP is a well-known molecule, I don\'t need to change it. So, the term is just ATP.\n\nLastly, c128 has the name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP and references EGF; EGFR. The role is product. Here, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest adding states like ""active"" as part of the term. So, combining these, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, prioritize the name column for consistency. So, the final JSON should have c150 mapped to ErbB1_ErbB4_P, c105 to ATP, and c128 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c160 + c105 => c124. There's a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c160, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3) and references are EGF; EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. Since it's a ligand bound to two receptors, I should represent this as a complex. The guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore, but here it's more of a complex. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The references column is empty, so I don't have synonyms. Since ATP is a common term, I'll just use ATP.\n\nFor c124, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP, references are EGF; EGFR. This seems similar to c160 but includes ATP. So it's the same complex as before but with ATP bound. According to guidelines, I can include states like 'bound' or 'active' with underscores. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word. For c160 and c124, the names are already multi-word but represent complexes, so using underscores makes sense. ATP is fine as is.\n\nChecking the guidelines again: if the name is an abbreviation, leave it. Since EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3 are abbreviations, it's acceptable to use them. Also, including 'bound' for the ATP makes the term more interpretable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map c160 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3, c105 to ATP, and c124 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound_ATP."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3"".\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9, but the references are empty. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple term, don\'t change it. So I\'ll just keep it as ""ATP"".\n\nFor c127, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3:ATP, and the references are the same as c146. So similar to c146, this is a complex but including ATP. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_ATP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, using underscores to connect parts. Since the guidelines allow for states like active or bound, but in this case, there\'s no such indication, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nLet me structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each id maps to the combined term without any additional changes unless necessary. I think this should satisfy the requirements.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x5 => x8, which I think represents a reaction where x5 transforms into x8. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n- For x5, the name is EGF-EGFR*^2, and references are EGF and EGFR.\n- For x8, the name is EGF-EGFRi*^2, with references EGFR and EGF.\n\nHmm, so x5 is the reactant, and x8 is the product. The asterisks and superscripts might indicate something about the state, like activation or binding.\n\nI need to map each id to a term. Let\'s start with x5. The name is EGF-EGFR*^2. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is a receptor. The asterisk and superscript 2 might denote that EGF is bound to EGFR, so the term could be EGF bound to EGFR. So, I should combine them as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nNext, x8\'s name is EGF-EGFRi*^2. The \'i\' might stand for inactive. So, this could be the inactive state of the EGF-EGFR complex. Therefore, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inactive"".\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. I\'m not changing the terms if they\'re already interpretable, but I\'m adding the state where necessary. Also, I\'m prioritizing the name column for consistency.\n\nSo, putting it together, the JSON should map x5 to ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" and x8 to ""EGF_EGFR_inactive"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Since EGF is a ligand and EGFR is its receptor, I can map Rp to ""EGFR_R"".\n- pShc_GS also has no name or reference. The term \'pShc\' might refer to a phosphorylated adaptor protein, perhaps Shc. \'GS\' is unclear, but maybe it\'s a state like \'GTPase\' or \'state\'.

Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as the free form of the EGFR receptor. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is unless necessary. However, since the name is freeEGFR, it\'s more precise to use the full term. But wait, the guideline says if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s better not to change it. So maybe fEGFR should just be ""EGFR"" because the name is freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. Hmm, perhaps ""EGFR_free"" or ""EGFR"" itself. But the replacement table\'s name is freeEGFR, which might suggest it\'s the free form, but in the guidelines, if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. So I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\' is fEGFR, and the \'name\' is freeEGFR. The reference is EGFR. So maybe I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is just a state. But according to the guidelines, if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t make changes. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, but perhaps it\'s better to use the full term. But the guidelines say not to make significant changes if the term is an abbreviation or is interpretable. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. So perhaps the correct term is ""EGFR"".\n\nThen EGF. The \'id\' is EGF, the \'name\' is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, and the name is EGF, which is a common abbreviation, it\'s better to keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The \'id\' is bEGFR, the \'name\' is boundEGFR, and the references are EGF and EGFR. So this is the bound form of the EGFR receptor. According to the guidelines, if we can identify the receptor, we should combine it with an underscore. So maybe ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_EGF"" since EGF is the ligand. But the guidelines say to consider states like ""bound"" as part of the term, so ""EGFR_bound"" might be appropriate. Alternatively, ""EGFR_EGF"" could indicate the complex. However, the name is boundEGFR, which suggests the state, so ""EGFR_bound"" seems fitting.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"", EGF to ""EGF"", and bEGFR to ""EGFR_bound"". That seems to align with the guidelines, using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and considering the states where applicable.\n\nI think that\'s the approach. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column, so for fEGFR, the name is freeEGFR, but the reference is EGFR. So perhaps I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is a state. Similarly, bEGFR is boundEGFR, so ""EGFR_bound"". EGF is straightforward as it\'s the ligand.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. Also, I should include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Prioritize the `name` column over `references` for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided, there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is Di00UU + L => DiL00UU; Di00UU, L. The replacement table has four entries.\n\nLet\'s go through each row in the replacement table:\n\n1. **Di00UU**: The role is reactants, id is Di00UU, name is Di00UU, references is EGFR. Since the name is the same as the id, and the reference is EGFR, which is a well-known receptor. So, I should map Di00UU to EGFR. Since it\'s a receptor, maybe I should write it as EGFR_R? But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is Di00UU, but the reference is EGFR. Hmm, but the guidelines mention that if the name isn\'t specific, use the reference. So perhaps I should map Di00UU to EGFR_R because it\'s a receptor.\n\n2. **L**: Role is reactants, id is L, name is L, reference is EGF. So L stands for EGF, which is a ligand. So I should map L to EGF_L.\n\n3. **DiL00UU**: Role is products, id is DiL00UU, name is DiL00UU, no references. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely a complex of Di00UU and L. So combining EGFR and EGF, it would be EGFR_EGF.\n\n4. **Modifiers**: There are two more entries for Di00UU and L, both modifiers. I think these are the same as the reactants, so their mappings would be the same: Di00UU as EGFR_R and L as EGF_L.\n\nWait, but the modifiers might refer to the same entities, so their terms are the same as in reactants. So in the JSON, each id is a key, and their values are the terms.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""EGFR_EGF""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines. I should make sure each term is a single word, and I\'ve connected receptor and ligand with underscores where necessary. Also, I used the references to map Di00UU to EGFR and L to EGF, then formed the complex for DiL00UU.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor and ligand involved, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But sometimes, I might need to do a two-step process: first map the `id` to the `name` using the table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy.\n\nI should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term, separated by an underscore. If the term is already simple or clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. If the `name` and `references` have synonyms, I should prioritize the `name` for consistency.\n\nLooking at their input, the equation is RcL00UU => Rc00UU + L; RcL00UU. The replacement table has four entries:\n\n1. Reactants: RcL00UU, name is RcL00UU, no references.\n2. Products: Rc00UU, name is Rc00UU, reference is EGFR.\n3. Products: L, name is L, reference is EGF.\n4. Modifiers: RcL00UU, same as the first entry.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically meaningful term. Starting with RcL00UU. The `name` is the same as the `id`, and there\'s no reference. So maybe it\'s a complex or a receptor-ligand pair. Since the products are Rc00UU (EGFR) and L (EGF), I can infer that RcL00UU is the bound state of EGFR and EGF. So the term should be EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nNext, Rc00UU has the name Rc00UU and reference EGFR. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the receptor alone, so EGFR.\n\nLastly, L is mapped to EGF, so the term is EGF.\n\nI think that covers all the `id`s in the replacement table. Now, putting it all together into a JSON object.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". The replacement table has ""bEGFR"" in the reactants with the name ""boundEGFR"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"". The products have ""null"" for both name and references.\n\nHmm, so the input equation is bEGFR => null. I need to map \'bEGFR\' to a biologically interpretable term. The replacement table says the name for \'bEGFR\' is \'boundEGFR\'. The references are \'EGFR\' and \'EGF\'. \n\nSince the name is \'boundEGFR\', that suggests it\'s the bound form of the EGF Receptor. In biology, EGFR is a receptor, and when it\'s bound, it\'s often referred to as being active or bound by its ligand, which is EGF. So the term should reflect that it\'s the receptor in a bound state.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, I should create a single word by combining the receptor name with the state. So ""boundEGFR"" can be ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"" since it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since the name is ""boundEGFR"", maybe it\'s acceptable as is. But the guidelines say if the term is reasonably interpretable, don\'t change it much. However, the example provided in the guidelines uses ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so perhaps using the underscore for states is better.\n\nWait, the example in the guidelines also mentions that if a term is simple, don\'t change it. So ""boundEGFR"" might be acceptable. But in the example, the user replaced ""R"" with ""IL6_R"" because ""R"" is ambiguous. Similarly, ""bEGFR"" is an abbreviation, but ""boundEGFR"" is more descriptive.\n\nSo, perhaps ""boundEGFR"" is a single word and doesn\'t need further splitting. Alternatively, maybe it\'s better to write it as ""EGFR_bound"" for clarity, but according to the guidelines, the name column should be prioritized if it\'s clear. Since ""boundEGFR"" is in the name column and is a single word, maybe that\'s acceptable.\n\nWait, the replacement table has ""id"" as ""bEGFR"" and ""name"" as ""boundEGFR"". So, according to the guidelines, I should use the name column for consistency. So the term should be ""boundEGFR"". But the guidelines also say that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, to use the underscore. But in this case, the name is ""boundEGFR"", which is already a single word. So perhaps it\'s okay.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the example, the user had ""R"" mapped to ""IL6_R"", so ""R"" becomes a more specific term. Similarly, ""bEGFR"" is an abbreviation, so maybe we should expand it. But the name is ""boundEGFR"", which is more descriptive. So perhaps the correct mapping is ""boundEGFR"".\n\nBut in the output example, the user provided ""EGFR_bound"" as the value for ""bEGFR"". So maybe they consider that the correct approach. So perhaps I should take the name ""boundEGFR"" and split it into ""EGFR_bound"" as the term.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is ""boundEGFR"", which is a single word, maybe that\'s acceptable. But the guidelines suggest that if a term can be more specific, like receptor or ligand, we should use the underscore. So perhaps ""EGFR_bound"" is better.\n\nI think the correct approach is to take the name ""boundEGFR"" and parse it into ""EGFR_bound"" because it\'s more consistent with the guidelines of using the underscore for states. So the JSON object should map ""bEGFR"" to ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nThe other part is the product, which is ""null"". Since the name and references are null, perhaps it\'s an inactive form or something else, but without more information, it\'s hard to map. But the output example only includes the ""bEGFR"" to ""EGFR_bound"", so maybe the ""null"" isn\'t included because there\'s no information.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON object should have ""bEGFR"" mapped to ""EGFR_bound"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term.

Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. The roles are reactants, products, and modifiers. Each id has a name and sometimes references. My task is to map each id to a single word term that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLet\'s go through each id one by one.\n\n1. **E**: The role is reactant, name is EGF, references are EGF. So, E should map to EGF. That\'s straightforward since it\'s already a single word and the name matches.\n\n2. **Empty**: The role is product, name is Empty, references are none. Since it\'s a product and the name is ""Empty"", I think it should stay as ""Empty"" because it\'s a state, not a specific molecule. The guidelines say if it\'s interpretable as-is, we don\'t change it.\n\n3. **E1**: Role is modifier, name is ErbB1, references EGFR. Now, ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, which is a receptor. So, since it\'s a receptor, I should denote it as such. The guidelines say to use an underscore if it\'s a receptor or ligand. So, ErbB1 is the receptor, so it becomes ""EGFR_R"". The name is ErbB1, but the reference is EGFR, so I\'ll go with the reference since it\'s more commonly known.\n\n4. **E_E1**: Role is modifier, name is EGF-ErbB1, references EGFR and EGF. Here, EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor. So, the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So, combining them with an underscore as ligand_receptor, it would be ""EGF_EGFR"". That makes sense because EGF binds to EGFR.\n\n5. **E1_PT**: Role is modifier, name is E1_p-PTP-1B, references are none. E1 is ErbB1 (EGFR), and p-PTP-1B is a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Since E1_PT involves a modification (phosphorylation by PTP-1B), I think it\'s about the receptor in a phosphorylated state. So, the term would be ""EGFR_R_bound"" because it\'s the receptor in a bound state, perhaps with the phosphatase.\n\n6. **E_E1_PT**: Role is modifier, name is E_E1_p-PTP-1B, references none. This seems to combine the ligand and the receptor in a modified state. So, it\'s EGF (ligand) bound to EGFR (receptor) which is phosphorylated. So, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" indicating the complex is in a bound state.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, using underscores where necessary. For example, combining ligand and receptor, or adding states like bound or active.\n\nLet me double-check each mapping:\n\n- E → EGF (correct)\n- Empty → Empty (correct)\n- E1 → EGFR_R (since it\'s the receptor)\n- E_E1 → EGF_EGFR (ligand-receptor pair)\n- E1_PT → EGFR_R_bound (receptor in bound state)\n- E_E1_PT → EGF_EGFR_bound (complex in bound state)\n\nThis seems to align with the guidelines, especially the part about using the name column but sometimes the reference if it\'s more interpretable.

For Ri, the name is empty, and there are no references. For Rd, the name is also empty, but the references mention EGF and EGFR.\n\nThe equation provided is Ri => Rd, which means Ri is a reactant and Rd is a product. My task is to map each id to a biologically interpretable term, preferably a single word. \n\nStarting with Ri: Since the name is empty and there are no references, I can\'t get specific info. The guidelines suggest using context if possible, but without any, I might have to keep it as is. Alternatively, since it\'s a reactant and often in biology, reactants can be receptors or ligands. But without more info, it\'s ambiguous. So maybe Ri remains as is, but I\'ll check if any default applies.\n\nFor Rd: The references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified specifically, connect them with an underscore. So, maybe Rd should be EGF_EGFR?

So, I map Ri to EGFR and Rd to EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word. EGF_EGFR_bound is three words joined by underscores, which fits the guidelines. Ri becomes EGFR, which is a single word.\n\nI think that\'s it. I should structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: R2 => RP. Then there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references. \n\nLet\'s break down the replacement table. For R2, the role is reactants, the id is R2, the name is (EGF_EGFR)2, and the references are EGF and EGFR. For RP, the role is products, id is RP, name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P, and reference is EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say each term in the JSON must be a single word. So, I need to make sure the mapped terms are concise. Also, if the term is a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, R becomes IL6_R, L becomes CSF1R_L.\n\nLooking at R2\'s name, it\'s (EGF_EGFR)2. I think EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. So, maybe R2 refers to a dimer of the EGF-EGFR complex. In that case, the term could be EGF_EGFR_dimer, combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore and adding \'dimer\' to indicate two units.\n\nFor RP, the name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P. The \'P\' might stand for phosphorylated, as that\'s a common notation in biological systems. So, the term could be EGF_EGFR_p, where \'p\' indicates phosphorylation. \n\nI should check if the names and references give any clues. For R2, the references are EGF and EGFR, which aligns with the name. For RP, the reference is only EGFR, but the name includes both EGF and EGFR. So, I think using EGF_EGFR_p makes sense here.\n\nI also need to consider if any terms need a two-step process. In this case, R2 maps to (EGF_EGFR)2, which I can interpret as a dimer, so I can directly map it to EGF_EGFR_dimer. Similarly, RP maps to (EGF_EGFR)2-P, which becomes EGF_EGFR_p.\n\nI should ensure that I\'m not making the terms too complicated. The guidelines say if the term is simple, don\'t change it much. Since EGF and EGFR are well-known, combining them with an underscore is appropriate.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have R2 mapping to ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" and RP mapping to ""EGF_EGFR_p"". That should satisfy all the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

I need to map each of these to their corresponding terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for c280, the name is RTK_Pase. RTK stands for Receptor Tyrosine Kinase. The term ""Pase"" might refer to the protease domain. So RTK_Pase makes sense as a single word, so I\'ll keep that as is.\n\nNext, c161 has the name (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4) and references EGF and EGFR. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, and ErbB4 is another receptor in the same family. So the term is a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. Since it\'s a receptor-ligand interaction, I should connect them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, so maybe EGF_L. The receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB4, but since they\'re together, perhaps it\'s better to represent them as a complex. Alternatively, the term could be EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4 receptors, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4? But the guidelines say to use the name column first, so I\'ll look at the name: (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4). The references include EGF and EGFR. Since EGFR is ErbB1, perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1, but since both ErbB1 and ErbB4 are present, maybe it\'s better to combine them. But the name is a bit ambiguous, so I need to find a more interpretable term. Perhaps EGF bound to both receptors, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But the guidelines suggest using the name column, so I might just use EGF_ErbB1 as a starting point, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since the references include EGF and EGFR, and EGFR is ErbB1, perhaps the term is EGF_EGFR, but the name in the table includes ErbB4 as well. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. Maybe I should look for a more specific term that combines both. Alternatively, since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), perhaps it\'s better to represent it as a complex, so maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But I need to make sure it\'s a single word. Alternatively, perhaps EGF_ErbB1 since ErbB4 might be a secondary receptor. I\'m a bit confused here, but I\'ll proceed with EGF_ErbB1 for now, considering the references.\n\nFor c282, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P:RTK_Pase. The references are empty. So this is a product, which is the RTK_Pase bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4. The term has a state ""P"" which probably stands for phosphorylated. So I should include that state. So it would be something like ErbB1_ErbB4_P bound to RTK_Pase. But how to combine them? The format should be a single word, so maybe ErbB1_ErbB4_P_RTK_Pase. But that seems a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s the RTK_Pase in the active state when bound to the receptors, so maybe RTK_Pase_active. But the name specifically mentions (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P:RTK_Pase. So maybe it\'s the RTK_Pase in a phosphorylated state when bound to the receptors. So perhaps RTK_Pase_P. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, the P might indicate the phosphorylation state of the receptors, so ErbB1_ErbB4_P, and then RTK_Pase. But how to combine them into a single term. Maybe RTK_Pase_bound_to_ErbB1_ErbB4_P. But that\'s too long. The guidelines say to use a single word, so perhaps I need to find a way to combine them succinctly. Maybe ErbB1_ErbB4_RTK_Pase_P. But I\'m not sure if that\'s accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the term is just RTK_Pase in the active state, so RTK_Pase_active.\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map from id to name, then refine using references. For c282, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P:RTK_Pase. The references are empty, so I have to rely on the name. The P might indicate a state, like phosphorylated. So perhaps the term should be RTK_Pase in the active state, so RTK_Pase_active. Alternatively, the P could be part of the receptor complex, so ErbB1_ErbB4_P. But since the product is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P:RTK_Pase, perhaps it\'s the RTK_Pase bound to the phosphorylated ErbB1 and ErbB4. So the term could be RTK_Pase_bound_to_ErbB1_ErbB4_P, but that\'s too long. Alternatively, since the guidelines say to use the name column first, perhaps the term is RTK_Pase, but considering the state, maybe RTK_Pase_P. But I\'m not entirely sure.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the JSON should map each id to its term as follows:\n\nc280: RTK_Pase (since it\'s a single word and interpretable)\nc161: EGF_ErbB1 (as per the references and name)\nc282: RTK_Pase_active (assuming the P indicates an active state)\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident about c161. The name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), which includes both receptors. Maybe I should include both, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4. But that\'s a bit long, but it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since the references include EGF and EGFR, and EGFR is ErbB1, maybe it\'s better to use EGF_EGFR. But the name includes ErbB4 as well, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4 is more accurate.\n\nSimilarly, for c282, maybe it\'s better to represent the phosphorylation state of the receptors, so ErbB1_ErbB4_P, and then RTK_Pase. But how to combine them. Perhaps RTK_Pase_bound_to_ErbB1_ErbB4_P, but that\'s too long. Maybe just RTK_Pase_P.\n\nI think I need to finalize the terms as:\n\n{\n  ""c280"": ""RTK_Pase"",\n  ""c161"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4"",\n  ""c282"": ""RTK_Pase_active""\n}\n\nBut I\'m still a bit unsure about c161. Alternatively, if the term is a ligand-receptor pair, it would be EGF_L_ErbB1_R, but the name in the table is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4), which might imply a complex. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4 is the best single word.\n\nI think that\'s the best I can do for now.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""R"" maps to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to check if the \'id\'s correspond to receptors or ligands. \n\nLooking at the input, the equation is a bit confusing: it\'s an id on the left pointing to another id on the right. The replacement table has three entries. The first two have the same id, mw0be0d193_fd6b_4824_8928_dbade8b5c99c, with role \'reactants\' and \'modifiers\', both mapping to EGF. The third id, mw280197c8_98de_43f0_bf01_0f332a1ab689, is a product and maps to EGFR.\n\nSo, I need to map each id to its corresponding term. The first id is EGF, which is a ligand. The second id is EGFR, which is a receptor. \n\nAccording to the guidelines, if it\'s a ligand or receptor, I should connect them with an underscore. But in the replacement table, EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, I should represent them as EGF_L and EGFR_R.\n\nI don\'t see any states mentioned, so I don\'t need to add anything like \'active\' or \'bound\'. Also, the names are already clear, so I don\'t need to change them. \n\nSo, the JSON should have two entries: the first id maps to ""EGF_L"" and the second to ""EGFR_R"". That should satisfy the requirements.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c530 + c16 => c10. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. Each id has a name and references which might be useful.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- c530 is a reactant, name is ""ErbB1_h:ATP"". Hmm, the name seems to combine two terms with a colon. The guidelines mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we can combine them with an underscore. So maybe ""ErbB1_ATP""?\n\n- c16 is EGF, and the references also point to EGF. Since it\'s a single term and straightforward, it stays as ""EGF"".\n\n- c10 is a product, name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. The name combines three terms. According to the guidelines, if it\'s a complex, we can join them with underscores. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the example, they used ""IL6_R_active"". So if c10 is a complex, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"" as a single term.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so colons in the name should be converted to underscores. Also, if there are states like active or bound, they should be added as underscores, but in this case, there\'s no indication of that.\n\nSo the mapping would be:\n\nc530 → ""ErbB1_ATP""\n\nc16 → ""EGF""\n\nc10 → ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP""\n\nI think that\'s correct. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term must be a single word, so replacing colons with underscores makes sense. The name column for c10 has all three components, so combining them into one term with underscores is appropriate. Since there\'s no state mentioned, I don\'t add anything else.', '', '', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state.

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Hmm, I need to look at the replacement table to see if any of the IDs are receptors or ligands.\n\nThe input provided is an equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries, two for reactants and two for products. The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR again, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K, with references like EGFR, EGF for the boundEGFR entries.\n\nSo, looking at the replacement table, the first step is to map each ID to its name. For example, bEGFR maps to boundEGFR, and PI3K maps to PI3K. Since the names are already provided, maybe I can use those as the terms unless they need further refinement.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t make significant changes. So, for PI3K, it\'s straightforward. But for bEGFR, since it\'s an abbreviation, maybe I should expand it. But the name is boundEGFR, which is more descriptive. So, I think I should use ""boundEGFR"" for the term.\n\nFor pPI3K, the name is pPI3K. I\'m not sure what the \'p\' stands for. It could be phosphorylated, so maybe I should consider that. The guidelines suggest including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term by using an underscore. So, perhaps I should map pPI3K to something like ""PI3K_phosphorylated"" or ""pPI3K_active"".\n\nBut the guidelines also mention that if the term is already reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. So, maybe ""pPI3K"" is acceptable as it is, but adding a state could make it more biologically accurate.\n\nHowever, looking back at the replacement table, the references for bEGFR include EGFR and EGF. So, perhaps EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand. So, in the replacement table, bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, which would be a receptor. So, for the term, I can use ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"". Since the name is boundEGFR, which is already descriptive, maybe I can just use that.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the name column. So, since the name is boundEGFR, I should use that as the term. Similarly, for pPI3K, the name is pPI3K, so I should use that unless I can make it more interpretable.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if pPI3K is a standard term. Maybe it\'s better to expand it to ""phosphorylated_PI3K"" or something like that. But the guidelines say to use the name column unless I can find a better term in the references. Since the references for pPI3K are empty, maybe I should just use ""pPI3K"" as is.\n\nWait, no, the references column for pPI3K is empty, so I can\'t get more information from there. So, I think I should just use the name, which is pPI3K.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its name. So, bEGFR maps to ""boundEGFR"", PI3K maps to ""PI3K"", and pPI3K maps to ""pPI3K"". Since these are all single words, they fit the guidelines.\n\nI don\'t think any of the terms need to be split into receptor or ligand because the names already indicate their state. For example, boundEGFR suggests it\'s the bound form of the receptor. So, I don\'t need to add an underscore for that.\n\nTherefore, the final JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""pPI3K"": ""pPI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it. I don\'t see any need for further changes because all the terms are single words and they\'re already interpretable based on the replacement table.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

That means I can\'t have phrases; I need to condense things into one word, possibly using underscores. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"".

The replacement table has four entries, each with an id, name, and references. The roles are either reactants or products.\n\nFor the first entry, id is bEGFR, name is boundEGFR, and the references point to EGFR and EGF. According to the guidelines, if the name is already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So, I can map bEGFR to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nNext, PI3K\'s name is PI3K, and the references include some URNs, but the name is straightforward. Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"".\n\nThe third entry is also bEGFR, same as the first one. So, it maps to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nThe last id is pPI3K, name is pPI3K, references include some URNs. Again, the name is straightforward, so I\'ll map it to ""pPI3K"".\n\nI should also consider if any of these terms need to be split into receptor or ligand. For example, if there was an \'R\' or \'L\' suffix, I would connect them with an underscore. But in this case, the ids are already in a format that\'s biologically meaningful without needing that step.\n\nI don\'t see any ambiguous terms here. The names are direct and don\'t require further refinement. Also, none of the terms have states like ""active"" or ""bound"" beyond what\'s already in the name, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object will have each id mapped to its corresponding name without any changes since they\'re already single words and biologically interpretable.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c163 + c105 => c124. There are three ids here: c163, c105, and c124. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c163. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB3)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB3 is HER3. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be a single word combining these. Since both are receptors, I can write them as EGFR_HER3_P. That makes sense because it\'s a complex of EGFR and HER3 in a phosphorylated state.\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"". The number seems to be a concentration or something, but the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"" as the term.\n\nFor c124, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP"" and the references include EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term should combine the ligand and receptors. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the complex is EGF bound to EGFR and HER3 (ErbB3). So, the term should be EGF_EGFR_HER3_ATP. This includes the ligand, both receptors, and the ATP.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, considering the state like active or bound is important, but in this case, the name doesn\'t specify a state beyond the presence of ATP. So, combining them as such should suffice.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON will have keys c163, c105, and c124 with their respective terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: x1 + x2 => x3. The replacement table has three IDs: x1, x2, and x3. The names are EGF, EGFR, and EGF-EGFR. The references for x3 are EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with x1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a ligand, I can denote it as EGF_L. That makes sense because ligands bind to receptors.\n\nNext, x2 is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR is a receptor, so I\'ll name it EGFR_R. That\'s straightforward.\n\nNow, x3 is a bit trickier. The name is EGF-EGFR, and the references are both EGF and EGFR. According to the guidelines, if the term is a combination, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. But since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, combining them as EGF-EGFR might already imply the complex. However, looking at the guidelines, I should consider the state. Since x3 is a product, it\'s likely the bound state of the receptor-ligand complex. So, I should denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nWait, let me think again. The guidelines say if it\'s a combination, use the name from the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, but the references are both EGF and EGFR. So maybe I should prioritize the name but also consider the biological state. Since it\'s a product, it\'s probably the bound form. So combining them with an underscore and adding the state makes sense. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example had ""IL6_R_active"". So the structure is ligand_receptor_state. Hmm, but in the case of x3, the product is the complex. So maybe it\'s better to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound or EGF_EGFR_bound. I think the correct way is to list the receptor first, followed by the ligand, then the state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because in the guidelines, they said to use the \'name\' column first. The name is EGF-EGFR, which is a bit ambiguous. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nWait, no. The guidelines say that if the term can be a single word, just use it. But since EGF-EGFR is a complex, and it\'s the product, it\'s in the bound state. So I should represent it as EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me check the example they provided. In the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So for a complex, maybe it\'s better to use receptor first, then ligand, then state. So EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nBut the name is EGF-EGFR, which is the same as EGF bound to EGFR. So perhaps EGF_EGFR_bound is more accurate.\n\nI think I should go with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nWait, but the references for x3 are EGF and EGFR. So the complex is EGF bound to EGFR. So in the JSON, x3 should be EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x1"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""x2"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""x3"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit uncertain about the ordering. Should it be EGF_EGFR or EGFR_EGF? The example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so maybe the receptor comes first. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nHmm, I think the correct approach is to use the order from the name column. Since the name is EGF-EGFR, I\'ll use that as the base and add the state. So EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, since EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps it\'s more accurate to denote it as EGFR_EGF_bound to show the receptor first.\n\nI\'m a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look up how such complexes are typically denoted. Usually, it\'s receptor-ligand, so EGFR_EGF_bound might be more standard.\n\nBut the name is EGF-EGFR, so perhaps that\'s how it should be written. I think I\'ll stick with EGF_EGFR_bound for x3.\n\nWait, another thought: the product is the result of the reaction, so it\'s the bound form of EGF and EGFR. So in biological terms, it\'s the EGF-EGFR complex, which is bound. So maybe just EGF_EGFR_bound is sufficient.\n\nI think I\'m overcomplicating it. The key is to use the name from the replacement table and add the state if applicable. So since x3\'s name is EGF-EGFR, and it\'s a product, it\'s in the bound state. So the term would be EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlright, I\'ll finalize that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

There\'s also a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, and references. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- x6 is EGFRi, referencing EGFR.\n- x16 is EGFi, referencing EGF.\n- x10 is EGF-EGFRi, referencing both EGFR and EGF.\n\nSo, for each id, I need to map it to a biologically meaningful term.\n\nStarting with x6: The name is EGFRi, and the reference is EGFR. EGFRi likely stands for EGFR inhibitor. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation and can be interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it much. So maybe just ""EGFRi"". But I should check if EGFRi is a standard term. If not, perhaps it\'s better to use ""EGFR"" since that\'s the reference. But the guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column, so I\'ll go with ""EGFRi"".\n\nNext, x16: The name is EGFi, referencing EGF. EGFi could stand for EGF inhibitor. Again, following the same logic as x6, I should use ""EGFi"" as per the name column.\n\nNow, x10: The name is EGF-EGFRi, and the references are EGFR and EGF. The guidelines suggest that if a receptor and ligand are involved, they should be connected with an underscore. So EGF is the ligand (L) and EGFR is the receptor (R). Therefore, the term should be ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its respective term, ensuring each is a single word where applicable and using the specified format for receptors and ligands.\n\nWait, but x10\'s name is ""EGF-EGFRi"".

The references for c10 include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. \n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with c6. The name is ErbB1:ATP. I know that ErbB1 is another name for the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). So, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is a ligand or a molecule it binds. Since the guidelines suggest that if receptor and ligand can be identified, we connect them with an underscore. So, ErbB1 would be the receptor, and ATP the ligand. But wait, ErbB1:ATP might already be a specific term, so maybe it\'s better to keep it as is since it\'s a single word. Or perhaps we need to split it into receptor and ligand.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So ErbB1:ATP might be a specific term, so we can keep it as c6: ""ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nNext is c16. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. EGF is an acronym for Epidermal Growth Factor, which is a ligand. So the term is straightforward. Since it\'s a single word, we can use it as c16: ""EGF"".\n\nNow for c10. The name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1. So the product is the complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. But the guidelines suggest that if a receptor and ligand can be identified, we can combine them with an underscore. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, the complex would be EGF_ErbB1. But the product also includes ATP. Hmm, how to handle that. The product might represent the active form of the receptor-ligand complex bound to ATP. So perhaps we can include the state as \'active\' or \'bound\'.\n\nLooking at the references, EGFR is the same as ErbB1, so the product is the active form of EGF bound to EGFR with ATP. So the term could be EGF_ErbB1_active or EGF_ErbB1_bound. But the guidelines suggest using \'bound\' or \'active\' as part of the term with an underscore.\n\nSince the product is the result of EGF binding to ErbB1 and ATP, it\'s likely an active state. So maybe the term is EGF_ErbB1_active.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product includes ATP, which might indicate a phosphorylation state, so \'active\' makes sense.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""c6"": ""ErbB1_ATP"",\n  ""c16"": ""EGF"",\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_ErbB1_active""\n}\n\nI think that makes sense. Each id is mapped to a single word term, using the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should use the replacement table and any references to make it more precise.\n\nLooking at their example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, when the role is a receptor or ligand, I should connect the abbreviation with an underscore. Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I include that with an underscore as well, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nNow, looking at their input. They have an equation: E_E1 + E_E1 => E11. The replacement table has three entries. Both reactants are E_E1 with the name ""EGF-ErbB1"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"". The product is E11 with the name ""(EGF-ErbB1)2"" and the same references.\n\nSo, for each `id`, I need to map it to a biologically accurate term. Let\'s start with E_E1. The name is ""EGF-ErbB1"". I need to make this a single word. Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, perhaps I should combine them. Wait, the role here is reactants, but the term is a complex. Maybe I should represent it as EGF bound to ErbB1. So, I could write it as ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" to indicate the bound state.\n\nFor the product, E11, the name is ""(EGF-ErbB1)2"", which implies a dimer. So, it\'s two EGF-ErbB1 complexes. Since it\'s a dimer, I should represent it as ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"". This way, it\'s clear it\'s the same complex in a dimer form.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it much. But in this case, E_E1 is an id, so I need to map it to a term. The name is ""EGF-ErbB1"", which is a bit long, but since I need a single word, I can combine them with underscores and add the state if necessary.\n\nAnother thought: Since the references include EGFR and EGF, I should consider using the most common abbreviations. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR"" would be more standard. But in the name, it\'s ""EGF-ErbB1"", and ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. So, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is better.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" for R, which is the receptor. So maybe I should treat E_E1 as a receptor-ligand complex. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand, ""ErbB1"" is the receptor. Therefore, the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1"" as a single word, but since they\'re bound, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"".\n\nBut looking at the product, it\'s (EGF-ErbB1)2, which is a dimer. So, perhaps the product should be ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map E_E1 to ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" and E11 to ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"".\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term is a single word, using underscores to combine receptor and ligand, and including states like bound or active. Since E_E1 is a reactant and forms a dimer in the product, using ""bound"" for the reactant makes sense, and ""dimer"" for the product.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table, there are two entries: Ri and Rd. For Ri, the name is empty, and there are no references. For Rd, the name is also empty, but the references mention EGF and EGFR.\n\nThe equation provided is Ri => Rd, which means Ri is a reactant and Rd is a product. My task is to map each id to a biologically interpretable term, preferably a single word. \n\nStarting with Ri: Since the name is empty and there are no references, I can\'t get specific info. The guidelines suggest using context if possible, but without any, I might have to keep it as is. Alternatively, since it\'s a reactant and often in biology, reactants can be receptors or ligands. But without more info, it\'s ambiguous. So maybe Ri remains as is, but I\'ll check if any default applies.\n\nFor Rd: The references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified specifically, connect them with an underscore. So, maybe Rd should be EGF_EGFR? But wait, the guidelines also mention considering states like ""bound"" or ""active"". Since EGF binds to EGFR, maybe it\'s in a bound state.\n\nSo, putting that together, Rd would be EGF_EGFR_bound. That makes sense because it\'s the ligand bound to the receptor.\n\nRi, since it\'s a reactant and likely the receptor before binding, would just be EGFR. So, I map Ri to EGFR and Rd to EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word. EGF_EGFR_bound is three words joined by underscores, which fits the guidelines. Ri becomes EGFR, which is a single word.\n\nI think that\'s it. I should structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object mapping each id in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, R becomes IL6_R. I need to make sure I\'m using the right context and references for accurate substitutions. Sometimes it\'s a two-step process: first map id to name, then refine with references.\n\nThe input includes an equation: mIRS => mIRSp; Rp, IRp. The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with mIRS. The name is empty, and references are empty. Since it\'s an abbreviation, I should leave it as is. So mIRS maps to ""mIRS"".\n\nNext, mIRSp. Similarly, name and references are empty. It\'s an abbreviation, so it stays ""mIRSp"".\n\nNow, Rp. The name is empty, but references are EGF and EGFR. Wait, EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So Rp is likely the receptor. Therefore, Rp should be ""EGFR_R"".\n\nThen, IRp. The name is empty, and references are empty. So IRp is an abbreviation and stays ""IRp"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to these terms. I\'ll make sure each key is the id and the value is the term, all in lowercase as per the example. So the final JSON is {""mirs"": ""mIRS"", ""mirsp"": ""mIRSp"", ""rp"": ""EGFR_R"", ""irp"": ""IRp""}.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: mGAB => mGABp; Rp, aSrc. It seems like mGAB is converted to mGABp, with Rp and aSrc as modifiers.\n\nNow, looking at the replacement table:\n\n- mGAB is a reactant with no name or reference provided. Since it's an abbreviation and there's no further information, I'll leave it as is.\n- mGABp is a product, also without a name or reference. So, it remains mGABp.\n- Rp is a modifier. The references mention EGF and EGFR. Since Rp is often an abbreviation for Receptor Protein, and in this context, EGFR is the receptor for EGF, I'll map Rp to EGFR.\n- aSrc is another modifier, with no name but references. aSrc likely stands for activated Src, a well-known tyrosine kinase. So, I'll map aSrc to Src.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its respective term without any additional changes where necessary."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is x6 + x16 => x10. The replacement table has three entries: x6 is EGFRi with a reference to EGFR, x16 is EGFi without a reference, and x10 is EGF-EGFRi with references to EGF and EGFR.\n\nFirst, I\'ll go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with x6. The name is EGFRi, and the reference is EGFR. EGFR stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. The \'i\' in EGFRi might stand for \'inhibitor\'. So EGFRi would be an inhibitor of the EGFR receptor. I should represent this as a single word, so maybe \'EGFR_inhibitor\'.\n\nNext is x16. The name is EGFi, and there\'s no reference. EGFi could be similar to EGFRi, but without the R. So perhaps it\'s EGF inhibitor. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor. So this would be \'EGF_inhibitor\'.\n\nThen, x10. The name is EGF-EGFRi, with references to EGF and EGFR. This seems to be the complex formed when EGF binds to the EGFR inhibitor. So, perhaps this is the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. So it would be \'EGF_EGFRi_active\' or maybe \'EGF-EGFRi_bound\'?\n\nWait, the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we can use an underscore. For example, R and L become something like IL6_R. So for x10, which is EGF-EGFRi, maybe we can represent this as EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor. But since EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is the ligand, perhaps the term should reflect that. So maybe \'EGF_L\' for the ligand and \'EGFR_R\' for the receptor, but in this case, it\'s the inhibitor.\n\nWait, but x6 is EGFRi, which is the inhibitor of EGFR. So x6 is the EGFR inhibitor. x16 is EGFi, which might be the inhibitor of EGF. But that doesn\'t make much sense because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are typically for receptors. Maybe EGFi is a typo, and it\'s supposed to be EGF, but since it\'s EGFi, I\'ll proceed with that.\n\nSo for x10, the product, which is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the EGFR inhibitor. But in biological terms, when a ligand binds to a receptor, it\'s usually the ligand and receptor together. But in this case, the inhibitor is involved, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x10 is the product of x6 and x16 reacting, so maybe it\'s the active form of the inhibitor when bound to EGF. But I\'m not entirely sure. The references for x10 are EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF and the inhibitor.\n\nWait, the name is EGF-EGFRi, so it\'s EGF connected to EGFRi. So maybe it\'s the EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor, making it active. So the term could be \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if a receptor or ligand can be identified, we use an underscore. So perhaps x6 is the receptor (EGFR_R) and x16 is the ligand (EGF_L). But in this case, x6 is EGFRi, which is an inhibitor, not the receptor itself. So maybe I need to represent it differently.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should represent x6 as \'EGFR_inhibitor\' and x16 as \'EGF_inhibitor\', but that seems a bit off because EGF is a ligand, and inhibitors are usually for receptors. So maybe x16 is actually EGF, but it\'s written as EGFi, perhaps a typo. But I have to go with what\'s given.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- x6: EGFRi → \'EGFR_inhibitor\'\n- x16: EGFi → \'EGF_inhibitor\' (though this is less common)\n- x10: EGF-EGFRi → \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFRi_active\'\n\nBut considering the references, x10 is linked to EGF and EGFR, so maybe it\'s the active form when EGF is bound to EGFR. But since the name is EGF-EGFRi, perhaps it\'s the inhibitor bound to EGF, making it active.\n\nI think I\'ll go with \'EGF_EGFRi_bound\' for x10, but I\'m not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe it\'s just \'EGF_EGFRi\' as a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. So EGFRi could be left as \'EGFRi\', but the name is EGFRi, so maybe it\'s better to represent it as \'EGFR_inhibitor\' for clarity.\n\nSimilarly, EGFi would be \'EGF_inhibitor\', but that\'s not a common term. Maybe it\'s a typo for EGF. But I\'ll proceed with \'EGF_inhibitor\' as per the name.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x6"": ""EGFR_inhibitor"",\n  ""x16"": ""EGF_inhibitor"",\n  ""x10"": ""EGF_EGFRi_bound""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about x16. Maybe it\'s supposed to be EGF, not EGFi. But according to the replacement table, it\'s EGFi, so I\'ll stick with that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps x16 is the ligand, so \'EGF_L\', but the name is EGFi, which is an inhibitor. So I think the initial approach is correct.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: R2 => RP. Then there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references. \n\nLet\'s break down the replacement table. For R2, the role is reactants, the id is R2, the name is (EGF_EGFR)2, and the references are EGF and EGFR. For RP, the role is products, id is RP, name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P, and reference is EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines say each term in the JSON must be a single word. So, I can\'t just use the name as it is because it\'s a bit complex. I need to simplify it based on the guidelines.\n\nStarting with R2. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2. From the guidelines, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. So EGF is a ligand and EGFR is the receptor. So R2 would be EGF_EGFR. But wait, the name is (EGF_EGFR)2, which implies a dimer. The guidelines mention that states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. So I think adding _bound would make sense here because the dimer suggests they\'re bound together. So R2 becomes EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nNow, looking at RP. The name is (EGF_EGFR)2-P, and the reference is EGFR. The \'P\' probably stands for phosphorylated. So this is the active form of the receptor after binding to EGF. According to the guidelines, I can add states like active. So combining EGFR with active gives EGFR_active.\n\nI should check if there are any other considerations. The guidelines say if a term is already simple, don\'t change it. But in this case, the names are a bit complex, so I need to simplify them. Also, I should prioritize the name column for consistency, which I\'m doing by taking EGF and EGFR from there.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map R2 to EGF_EGFR_bound and RP to EGFR_active.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

So, I need to apply similar logic here. The input has an equation Rd => Rp and a replacement table with two rows.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For role \'reactants\', id \'Rd\' has no name but references \'EGF; EGFR\'.\n- For role \'products\', id \'Rp\' also has no name but the same references.\n\nSo, both Rd and Rp are mapped to the same references: EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The task is to map each id to a biologically meaningful term.\n\nSince both have the same references, I need to figure out what each id represents. Rd is a reactant, which in biological terms, could be the unbound ligand. Rp is a product, which could be the bound form, like the ligand bound to the receptor.\n\nSo, for Rd, since it\'s the reactant, it\'s likely the ligand EGF. So, the term would be \'EGF\'. For Rp, as the product, it\'s the receptor-ligand complex. So, combining them, it would be \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. So, maybe for Rp, it\'s the receptor with the ligand bound. So, the term would be \'EGFR_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFR_bound\'? Hmm, but the example shows \'IL6_R\' for \'R\', which is the receptor. So perhaps for the product, which is the bound form, we should include both the receptor and the ligand, and the state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is just the receptor in its active or bound state. Since the product is formed after the reaction, it\'s likely the bound form. So, combining the receptor with the state \'bound\' would make sense.\n\nSo, for Rd, since it\'s the reactant, it\'s EGF. For Rp, since it\'s the product, it\'s EGFR in the bound state with EGF. But the guidelines suggest using the name column if available, but here the name is empty. So, I need to rely on the references.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rd is the receptor (EGFR) in the unbound state, and Rp is the receptor in the bound state with EGF. But the references for both are EGF and EGFR, so perhaps Rd is EGF (ligand) and Rp is the complex.\n\nWait, but in the equation Rd => Rp, it\'s a transformation. So, perhaps Rd is the receptor (EGFR) and Rp is the receptor-ligand complex. But since both have the same references, I\'m a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking back at the replacement table, both Rd and Rp have references EGF and EGFR. So, Rd is a reactant, which is likely the receptor (EGFR) before binding.

So, I need to create terms based on the references.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rd is EGF (the ligand) and Rp is the bound complex. So, Rd would be \'EGF\' and Rp would be \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me think again. The equation is Rd => Rp. In biological terms, this could represent the binding of EGF to EGFR, forming the bound complex. So, Rd is EGF (the ligand) and Rp is the bound complex.\n\nSo, for Rd, the term would be \'EGF\'. For Rp, it\'s the receptor bound to EGF, so \'EGFR_bound\' or \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine with an underscore. So, perhaps \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' is more accurate.\n\nWait, but the example used \'IL6_R\' for \'R\' and \'CSF1R_L\' for \'L\', which are single words. So, maybe \'EGFR_bound\' is sufficient, as it\'s a single word combining the receptor and the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s better to include both the receptor and ligand in the term, but that would make it two words. Hmm, but the guidelines specify a single word. So, perhaps \'EGFR_bound\' is the way to go.\n\nWait, but the references for both are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps for Rd, it\'s the ligand EGF, and for Rp, it\'s the receptor in the bound state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rd is the receptor before binding, and Rp is the receptor after binding. So, Rd would be \'EGFR\' and Rp would be \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for similar examples. In the given example, \'R\' maps to \'IL6_R\' and \'L\' maps to \'CSF1R_L\'. So, perhaps for Rd, which is a reactant, it\'s the ligand, and Rp is the receptor in the bound state.\n\nSo, Rd is EGF, so the term is \'EGF\'. Rp is the bound receptor, so \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rp is the complex, so \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' but that\'s three words. Wait, the guidelines say each term must be a single word, so perhaps \'EGFR_bound\' is better.\n\nWait, but in the example, \'R\' is \'IL6_R\' which is receptor, and \'L\' is \'CSF1R_L\' which is ligand. So, perhaps in this case, Rd is the ligand, and Rp is the receptor with the ligand bound.\n\nSo, Rd would be \'EGF\', and Rp would be \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rp is the receptor-ligand complex, so \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' but that\'s two parts, so maybe just \'EGFR_bound\' is acceptable.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go.

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the `name` column over `references` for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input. The equation is Rp_RasGAP => Rp + RasGAP; mGABp_SHP2, mGABp_pSHP2, mGABp_pSHP2_GS. The replacement table has several rows. Let me go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with Rp_RasGAP. The role is reactants, id is Rp_RasGAP, name is empty, and references are empty. Since the name is empty, I might need to look at the references or context. From the equation, it\'s split into Rp and RasGAP. Looking at the products, Rp is mapped to EGF; EGFR. So Rp is part of EGFR. RasGAP is another product, which is just RasGAP. So Rp_RasGAP would be EGFR_RasGAP. But wait, the guideline says if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine. Since name is empty, maybe it\'s best to keep it as Rp_RasGAP unless more info is available. Hmm, but the products are Rp and RasGAP, which are separate. So perhaps the reactant is the complex of EGFR and RasGAP, hence EGFR_RasGAP.\n\nNext, Rp. It\'s a product, name is EGF; EGFR. The guidelines say to prioritize the name column. The name has two options: EGF and EGFR. Which one to pick? Since EGFR is the receptor, and EGF is the ligand, but the id is Rp. In the equation, Rp is part of the product, so perhaps Rp is the receptor part, so EGFR. So Rp maps to EGFR.\n\nRasGAP is a product, name is RasGAP, references are empty. Since it\'s already a known term, we can keep it as RasGAP.\n\nMoving on to modifiers: mGABp_SHP2, mGABp_pSHP2, mGABp_pSHP2_GS. The name and references are empty. So I need to figure out what these are. mGABp likely stands for some protein, maybe a mutant or modified version. SHP2 is a known phosphatase, often involved in signaling. The p in pSHP2 might indicate phosphorylation. So mGABp_SHP2 could be mGABp_SHP2, mGABp_pSHP2 as mGABp_pSHP2, and mGABp_pSHP2_GS where GS might stand for something else, maybe a state like ""G protein"" or another modification. But without more context, I\'ll keep them as they are.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to the terms I derived. I need to make sure each key is the id and the value is the single word term. So:\n\n{\n  ""Rp_RasGAP"": ""EGFR_RasGAP"",\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""RasGAP"": ""RasGAP"",\n  ""mGABp_SHP2"": ""mGABp_SHP2"",\n  ""mGABp_pSHP2"": ""mGABp_pSHP2"",\n  ""mGABp_pSHP2_GS"": ""mGABp_pSHP2_GS""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best I can do with the given information. I hope I didn\'t miss anything in the guidelines. Let me double-check: each term is a single word, receptors and ligands are connected with underscores, states are included if applicable, and I prioritized the name column. Seems good.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, looking at the replacement table, there are two entries: Rp and Null. For Rp, the role is reactants, the id is Rp, the name is empty, and the references are EGF and EGFR. For Null, the role is products, the id is Null, and the references are empty.\n\nThe guidelines mention that each term must be a single word. If the term is a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. But for Rp, since the name is empty, we have to rely on the references, which are EGF and EGFR. EGF stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. \n\nSince Rp is in the reactants, it\'s likely referring to the receptor because reactants in biological reactions often involve the binding of a ligand to a receptor. So, the receptor here is EGFR. Therefore, Rp should be mapped to ""EGFR_R"".\n\nFor Null, since there\'s no name or references, and it\'s a simple term, we leave it as ""Null"".\n\nSo, the JSON object should map Rp to ""EGFR_R"" and Null remains ""Null"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. Then, there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe replacement table has three rows:\n1. Role: reactants, id: EGF, name: (empty), references: EGF\n2. Role: reactants, id: EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGFR\n3. Role: products, id: L_EGFR, name: (empty), references: EGF; EGFR\n\nThe task is to map each id to a biologically interpretable term, following the guidelines.\n\nLet me go through the guidelines one by one.\n\n1. Each term must be a single word. So, no spaces, just one word each.\n\n2. Replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using the replacement table. So, if the id is something like \'R\' or \'L\', I need to connect the receptor and ligand names with an underscore. For example, \'R\' becomes \'IL6_R\' and \'L\' becomes \'CSF1R_L\'.\n\n3. If it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, looking at the input, EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand. The product is L_EGFR, which seems to be a ligand-receptor complex.\n\n4. Sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name using the replacement table, then refine it using references. In this case, the replacement table doesn\'t have names filled, so I might need to rely on the references or common knowledge.\n\n5. Include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"".\n\n6. If the term is a simple abbreviation or already interpretable, don\'t change it much. So, EGF and EGFR are already known terms, so they might stay as they are.\n\n7. Prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency, but in this case, the name column is empty, so I\'ll have to rely on references or common usage.\n\n8. Output as a JSON object with id as the key and the term as the value.\n\nSo, starting with each id:\n\n- EGF: The name is empty, but the reference is EGF. Since EGF is a well-known ligand, it\'s a single word and doesn\'t need to be changed. So, map EGF to ""EGF"".\n\n- EGFR: Similarly, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So, map EGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\n- L_EGFR: The reference is both EGF and EGFR, so this is likely the ligand-receptor complex. Following the guideline, I should create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, the complex would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the id is L_EGFR. The guidelines mention that for products, if it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, we might need to create a term like that. But in this case, the product is L_EGFR, which might be a way to denote the bound form. So perhaps it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or something similar.\n\nBut looking back, the guidelines say that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. Since the name is empty, perhaps the name is the same as the id, but the references are EGF and EGFR, so the product is the complex of EGF and EGFR.\n\nSo, perhaps for L_EGFR, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines shows that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, in this case, since L_EGFR is a product, maybe it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product is a bound state, maybe it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to change it. Since L_EGFR is an id, but the name is empty, perhaps it\'s better to use the product term as the complex. But I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the equation is EGF + EGFR => L_EGFR. So, L_EGFR is the product, which is likely the ligand-bound receptor. So, in biological terms, it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR. So, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut in the replacement table, the references for L_EGFR are EGF and EGFR, which suggests that it\'s a complex of both. So, perhaps the term should be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut according to the guidelines, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So, for the product, which is a complex, maybe it\'s better to write it as ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, since the product is the bound form, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is more accurate.\n\nBut the user\'s example shows that for R, it\'s ""IL6_R"" and for L, it\'s ""CSF1R_L"". So, perhaps for the product, which is a ligand-receptor complex, it\'s better to write it as ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n- EGF: ""EGF""\n- EGFR: ""EGFR""\n- L_EGFR: ""EGF_EGFR""\n\nWait, but in the equation, the product is L_EGFR, which is the ligand-receptor complex. So, perhaps the term should reflect that it\'s the bound state. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the guidelines don\'t specify that the product has to include the state. It\'s optional. So, perhaps it\'s sufficient to write ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nAlternatively, considering that the product is a complex, maybe it\'s better to include ""bound"" to indicate the state.\n\nBut I\'m not sure. The guidelines say that if a state like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included, do so by joining with an underscore. So, in this case, since the product is the result of EGF binding to EGFR, it\'s in a bound state. So, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n  ""EGFR"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L_EGFR"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, the references for L_EGFR are both EGF and EGFR, so it\'s definitely the complex. So, to make it a single word, connecting them with an underscore, and adding the state if necessary.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the order doesn\'t matter much, but perhaps the ligand comes first, so ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nSo, final mapping:\n\n""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n""EGFR"": ""EGFR"",\n""L_EGFR"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound""\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure if the state is necessary. The guidelines say it\'s optional, but it\'s recommended if applicable. So, including it makes it more accurate.\n\nSo, I think that\'s the way to go.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any receptors or ligands listed in the ""name"" column. The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K. The references for bEGFR are EGFR and EGF, which are the receptor and ligand. So maybe I need to use those references to figure out the receptor and ligand terms.\n\nThey also mentioned considering states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and including them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". In the replacement table, the names include ""boundEGFR"", so maybe that\'s a state. \n\nLooking at the input equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. So the reactants are boundEGFR and PI3K, and the products are the same boundEGFR and phosphorylated PI3K. \n\nThe replacement table has bEGFR mapped to boundEGFR, which refers to EGFR (the receptor) and EGF (the ligand). So perhaps bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, meaning the receptor is bound by EGF. Therefore, the term could be ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nFor PI3K, the name is PI3K, and there\'s no reference. Since it\'s a kinase, maybe it\'s just ""PI3K"" as it is. The products have pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K, so that would be ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nWait, but the user said if a term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. So PI3K is fine as is, but pPI3K should become ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. For bEGFR, since it\'s bound, it\'s ""EGFR_bound"". PI3K stays as ""PI3K"". pPI3K becomes ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. Each id is mapped correctly, and the terms are single words with states included when necessary.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object mapping each id in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it with references. Also, include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" if needed, connected with an underscore. If the term is already clear, don\'t change it much. Prioritize the name column for consistency.\n\nNow, the input equation is c3 + c529 => c550. The replacement table has three entries: c3, c529, and c550. Let\'s break them down.\n\nStarting with c3: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references are ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR), and ATP is a molecule involved in signaling. The term should be a single word. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, maybe combine them as EGF_EGFR. But wait, the name includes ATP, but the guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible. So, I\'ll go with EGF_EGFR.\n\nNext, c529: The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The ""h"" might indicate a conformational state, like ""active"" or ""bound"". So, perhaps this is EGF bound to the active form of EGFR. So, the term could be EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nNow, c550: The name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ATP::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". This looks like a dimer or complex of two EGF-EGFR-ATP units, one in the regular state and one in the active state. So, maybe it\'s the active dimer. Combining them, it would be EGF_EGFR_dimer_active.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'ll use underscores to connect them. Also, I\'ll check if any of the terms can be simplified. For c3 and c529, they both involve EGF and EGFR, just different states. c550 is a complex of both, so the dimer with active state makes sense.\n\nLet me review the guidelines again. Do I need to include the ATP? The guidelines say to focus on receptor and ligand if possible, so maybe omitting ATP is okay since it\'s part of the reaction but not the primary biological term. Also, the references for c3 include EGF, ATP, and EGFR, so I think combining EGF and EGFR is appropriate.\n\nI think that\'s it. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, ensuring each id maps correctly.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c530 + c16 => c10. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. Each id has a name and references which might be useful.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- c530 is a reactant, name is ""ErbB1_h:ATP"". Hmm, the name seems to combine two terms with a colon. The guidelines mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we can combine them with an underscore. So maybe ""ErbB1_ATP""?\n\n- c16 is EGF, and the references also point to EGF. Since it\'s a single term and straightforward, it stays as ""EGF"".\n\n- c10 is a product, name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. The name combines three terms. According to the guidelines, if it\'s a complex, we can join them with underscores. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the example, they used ""IL6_R_active"". So if c10 is a complex, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"" as a single term.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so colons in the name should be converted to underscores. Also, if there are states like active or bound, they should be added as underscores, but in this case, there\'s no indication of that.\n\nSo the mapping would be:\n\nc530 → ""ErbB1_ATP""\n\nc16 → ""EGF""\n\nc10 → ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP""\n\nI think that\'s correct. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term must be a single word, so replacing colons with underscores makes sense. The name column for c10 has all three components, so combining them into one term with underscores is appropriate. Since there\'s no state mentioned, I don\'t add anything else.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c11 => c86. The replacement table has two rows. For c11, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. For c86, the name is ""R_degraded"" with no references.\n\nStarting with c11. The name is a bit complex: ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor, also known as EGFR. ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate. The term is a trimer, so it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 with ATP. Since it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, I should combine them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, so it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1"". The \'2\' might indicate dimerization, but the guidelines say to keep it a single word, so I\'ll omit the number. So, c11 maps to ""EGF_ErbB1"".\n\nNext, c86. The name is ""R_degraded"". From the references of c11, R likely stands for receptor, which is ErbB1 or EGFR. So, ""R_degraded"" should be more specific. Since the receptor is EGFR, I\'ll use ""EGFR_degraded"". The guidelines mention using context, and here, the context is from c11\'s references. So c86 becomes ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, and states like \'degraded\' are included with an underscore. Also, I\'m prioritizing the name column but using references to clarify when needed. Since c86\'s name is ""R_degraded"" and the reference isn\'t provided, but from c11, R is EGFR, so it\'s logical to map it that way.\n\nI think that\'s all.

The replacement table has three entries: Rp_pShc, Rp, and pShc. The references for Rp are EGF and EGFR, while pShc doesn\'t have any references.\n\nStarting with Rp_pShc, since it\'s a reactant and doesn\'t have a name or reference, I\'ll need to break it down. The product side has Rp and pShc. From the references, Rp is linked to EGF and EGFR. I know that EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is its receptor. So, Rp might stand for EGF receptor. Similarly, pShc is probably Shc, a signaling protein, perhaps in a phosphorylated state.\n\nSo, combining Rp and pShc, I think Rp_pShc should be EGF receptor bound to Shc. Since it\'s a complex, I\'ll use an underscore to combine them: ""EGFR_bound_Shc"".\n\nNext, looking at Rp, it\'s a product with references EGF and EGFR. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, I should represent this as ""EGF_L"" because it\'s the ligand form. That\'s a single word, so that\'s good.\n\nFor pShc, there\'s no reference, but it\'s a product. It\'s likely the phosphorylated form of Shc. So I\'ll represent it as ""Shc_active"" to indicate its active state.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each term is a single word, using underscores where necessary and including states if applicable. I also need to avoid making unnecessary changes if the term is already clear.\n\nSo, the final JSON would have ""Rp_pShc"" mapped to ""EGFR_bound_Shc"", ""Rp"" to ""EGF_L"", and ""pShc"" to ""Shc_active"".

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""x3"" maps to ""EGF-EGFR"" and ""x4"" maps to ""EGF-EGFR^2"". The references for both are ""EGF; EGFR"". My task is to convert these into more interpretable terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, x3 is ""EGF-EGFR"". I think this refers to the ligand EGF bound to its receptor EGFR. Similarly, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimerized form, perhaps after binding.\n\nI need to consider the guidelines. Since ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor, I should map them as ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R"". But wait, the replacement table shows ""EGF-EGFR"" as a single term. Maybe it\'s a complex of the ligand and receptor.\n\nHmm, the user\'s example suggests that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the table, then refine it with references. So, for x3, the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", and the references are EGF and EGFR. So, I should represent this as a complex where EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. Maybe combine them into ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. So, ""EGF"" is a ligand, ""EGFR"" is a receptor. So, maybe ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"". But that\'s two words, and the user wants a single word. Wait, the example shows ""IL6_R"" as a single word. So perhaps I can combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"" without the \'L\' and \'R\' because it\'s a complex.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines shows ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becoming ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the term is already a complex, perhaps I should just use the combined name as a single term. So, ""EGF-EGFR"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nBut looking at the references, both x3 and x4 have EGF and EGFR. So, x3 is the reactant, which is the unbound form, and x4 is the product, which is the bound or dimerized form. So, for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_active"" or ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include states like \'active\' or \'bound\' unless necessary. So, maybe x4 is the dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" or ""EGF_EGFR_2"".\n\nWait, in the replacement table, x4 is ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, to represent this, I can add ""_dimer"" or just use ""_2"". But the guidelines say to include states with an underscore. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t add any state, just the combined term. So, perhaps for x3, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR"" as the reactant, and x4 is ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" as the product.\n\nAlternatively, since x4 is the product of the reaction x3 => x4, it\'s the bound form. So, maybe x4 should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nBut the references for both x3 and x4 are the same, so maybe the only difference is the state. So, I think the correct approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed ""R"" and ""L"" being combined. So, perhaps I should map x3 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R"" and x4 as ""EGF_L_EGFR_R_active"" or something similar. But that would be two words, and the user wants a single word. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to just combine them into a single term without the \'L\' and \'R\' since the complex is a single entity.\n\nAlternatively, since the name is ""EGF-EGFR"", I can use that as the term, replacing the hyphen with an underscore, making it ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nSo, for x3, the term is ""EGF_EGFR"", and for x4, since it\'s the product, it\'s the same complex but in a different state. The replacement table shows it as ""EGF-EGFR^2"", which might indicate a dimer. So, I can add ""_dimer"" to it, making it ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nAlternatively, since the user\'s example didn\'t add any state unless necessary, maybe I should just leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, but that doesn\'t capture the difference between x3 and x4.\n\nWait, the user\'s example in the guidelines showed that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not changed. So, if ""EGF-EGFR"" is a standard term, maybe I can leave it as ""EGF_EGFR"" for x3 and ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"" for x4.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe the better approach is to map x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" to indicate the active form after binding.\n\nI think I\'ll go with that. So, the JSON object would have x3 as ""EGF_EGFR"" and x4 as ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. The user wants each term to be a single word. If there\'s an ambiguous term, I need to replace it with something more specific using the replacement table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column over \'references\' for consistency. Finally, the output should be a JSON object without any extra comments.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x8 => x87. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n1. reactants: x8 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" with references EGFR and EGF.\n2. products: x87 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" with no references.\n\nI need to process each id (x8 and x87) and map them to the correct terms.\n\nStarting with x8:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"". The references are EGFR and EGF. I know that EGFR is the receptor and EGF is the ligand. The \'i\' likely stands for \'inhibitor\', and the \'*^2\' might be a subscript indicating a dimer or something similar. Since the name isn\'t a single word, I need to make it one. Combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore makes sense. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor. The ""i*^2"" part could refer to an inhibited dimer. Maybe I can represent this as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is too long. Alternatively, maybe it\'s better to simplify. Since ""EGF-EGFRi"" might mean EGF bound to an inhibited EGFR, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". But the ""*^2"" might indicate a dimer, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". Hmm, but the user wants a single word, so I need to combine them without spaces. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so it\'s about state. So maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" is better, and the ""*^2"" could be ""dimer"" but that\'s another state. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the format as per the name, so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". The ""*^2"" might be a superscript indicating a dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable, but I\'m not sure if it\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_i"" with the understanding that \'i\' stands for inhibited. But the user\'s guidelines say to avoid making significant changes if the term is already interpretable. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", which might be a shorthand. So maybe the best approach is to convert ""EGF-EGFRi"" into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and the ""*^2"" as ""dimer"", so combining them as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But that\'s a bit long, but it\'s a single word.\n\nNow for x87:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"". The \'deg\' likely stands for \'degradation\' or \'degenerate\', but in biological terms, it\'s more about degradation. So the process is the degradation product of the inhibited dimer. So following the same logic as x8, we can take ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" and convert it into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"" or ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded_dimer"". But again, it\'s a single word. Alternatively, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_deg"" but \'deg\' is not as clear. Perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"" is better, indicating the state of being degraded.\n\nWait, but the references for x8 include EGFR and EGF, so the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So in the name, ""EGF-EGFRi"" is the ligand-receptor complex, where the receptor is inhibited. The ""*^2"" is a dimer, so two receptors. So perhaps the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". For x87, it\'s the same but degraded, so ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", which is a single word with the state. So maybe for x8, the term is ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and for x87, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \'i\' in the name stands for \'inhibited\', so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"", and the ""*^2"" is a dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". Then x87, being the degradation product, would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure if \'dimer\' is necessary, or if it\'s implied. Maybe the user just wants ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example uses ""IL6_R_active"", which combines the ligand and receptor with an underscore and then the state. So for x8, since it\'s a reactant, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the product, which is the degradation product, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include the dimer part, so maybe I should consider whether the dimer is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the ""*^2"" is a subscript indicating a dimer, so it\'s part of the term. So ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ""*^2"" is a reference to a specific form, but since the user wants a single word, I need to include it. So perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object would map x8 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and x87 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", so perhaps the format is ligand_receptor_state. So for x8, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the degraded form, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \'deg\' in x87\'s name stands for \'degraded\', so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nI think that\'s the approach to take.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I also need to consider if more context is needed, like states such as ""bound"" or ""active"". \n\nThe user mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name` using the table, then refine it using references. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency. If the term is already an abbreviation and clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is Rc00UU + L => RcL00UU; Rc00UU, L. The replacement table has rows with role, id, name, and references. For reactants, Rc00UU maps to Rc00UU with a reference to EGFR. L maps to L with a reference to EGF. The products row for RcL00UU doesn\'t have a reference, and modifiers have the same mappings as reactants.\n\nSo, I need to map each id: Rc00UU, L, RcL00UU. From the replacement table, Rc00UU is associated with EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I can represent it as EGFR_R. L is associated with EGF, a ligand, so that would be EGF_L. For RcL00UU, which is a product, it\'s the complex of Rc00UU and L, so combining EGFR and EGF, it should be EGFR_EGF. Since it\'s the bound state, I\'ll add ""_bound"" to make it EGFR_EGF_bound.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. I think I\'ve covered all the guidelines and provided the correct JSON structure as required.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. If I come across terms like ""R"" or ""L"", which stand for receptor and ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But I have to be careful because sometimes the receptor or ligand names aren\'t in the ""name"" column. I need to use context and references to figure them out accurately.\n\nAnother point is that sometimes a two-step process is needed. I might first map the `id` to the `name` using the table and then refine it further using the references for better biological accuracy. For example, if an `id` maps to a general term, the references might provide a more specific term.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, connected with an underscore. So, if a protein is in a bound state, I would name it like ""IL6_R_active"" instead of just ""IL6_R"".\n\nIf the term is already a simple abbreviation or is easily understandable as is, I shouldn\'t change it much. It\'s about balance—making it interpretable without overcomplicating it.\n\nThe user also mentioned that if the `name` and `reference` columns have similar terms or synonyms, I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency and clarity. That makes sense because the `name` is likely the primary term they want to use.\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided. The equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each `id`:\n\n1. **bEGFR**: The `name` is ""boundEGFR"", and the references point to EGFR and EGF. Since ""boundEGFR"" is already a specific term indicating the bound state of EGFR, I can map it directly to ""boundEGFR"".\n\n2. **PI3K**: The `name` is ""PI3K"", and the references are urn:miriam:omit:0027264. PI3K is a well-known acronym for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. It\'s a simple abbreviation, so I don\'t need to change it.\n\n3. **bEGFR** again, same as the first one, so it maps to ""boundEGFR"".\n\n4. **pPI3K**: The `name` is ""pPI3K"", and the references include urn:miriam:omit:0027264 and urn:miriam:bao:0002007. ""pPI3K"" stands for phosphorylated PI3K, indicating an active state. So, I can map this to ""pPI3K"".\n\nI need to make sure that each `id` is correctly mapped, and if any of these terms require further refinement based on the references, I should do that. But in this case, the names are straightforward and already provide the necessary biological context.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have each `id` as a key and the corresponding term as the value. The final output would be a JSON object with ""bEGFR"" mapped to ""boundEGFR"" and ""PI3K"" and ""pPI3K"" mapped to their respective terms.\n\nI should double-check to ensure that all terms are single words and that any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" are included. Since ""boundEGFR"" already includes the state, and ""pPI3K"" implies phosphorylation (an active state), I don\'t need to add anything else.\n\nI think that covers everything. Let me structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is species_25 + species_1 => species_0. So, we\'re dealing with three species here: 25, 1, and 0.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- species_25 is mapped to EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is also EGF. Since EGF is already a well-known ligand, I don\'t need to change it. So, species_25 should just be EGF.\n\n- species_1 is mapped to free_EGFR, but the reference is EGFR. The name is \'free_EGFR\', which suggests it\'s the free form of the receptor. According to the guidelines, if the term is a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. But since \'free_EGFR\' is more specific, indicating it\'s the unbound form, I should use that. So, species_1 becomes free_EGFR.\n\n- species_0 is mapped to pEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The name is \'pEGFR\', which stands for phosphorylated EGFR. This is a specific state of the receptor, so I should keep it as pEGFR.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word and use underscores where necessary. For example, \'free_EGFR\' is a single term connected by an underscore. Similarly, \'pEGFR\' is already a single term.\n\nI don\'t see any ambiguity here, so no further refinements are needed. Each id maps directly to its name without requiring additional context from the references beyond what\'s provided.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have species_25 as ""EGF"", species_1 as ""free_EGFR"", and species_0 as ""pEGFR"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Similarly, if it\'s ""L"", maybe ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the id to the name using the replacement table, and then refine it using references for biological accuracy. So I need to check both the name and reference columns.\n\nLooking at the input equation: DiL00UU equals Di00UU plus L, and it\'s part of the modifiers. The replacement table has three entries. Let\'s look at each id:\n\n1. DiL00UU: It\'s in the role of reactants and modifiers. The name is DiL00UU, and there\'s no reference provided. Since there\'s no additional info, maybe it\'s an abbreviation or a specific term that\'s already interpretable as-is. So perhaps it stays as ""DiL00UU"".\n\n2. Di00UU: This is a product, and the name is the same. The reference is EGFR, which stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So according to the guidelines, since the reference is more specific, but the name is ""Di00UU"", I need to check if it\'s a standard abbreviation. If Di00UU is an abbreviation for EGFR, then maybe the term should be ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say if the name is already interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. Wait, but in the example given, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" because it\'s a receptor. Here, the reference is EGFR, which is a receptor. So perhaps Di00UU should be mapped to ""EGFR"" since it\'s the receptor.\n\n3. L: This is a product, name is L, and the reference is EGF, which is Epidermal Growth Factor. Since L is an abbreviation, and it\'s a ligand, according to the guidelines, I should combine the ligand term with ""L"". So maybe ""EGF_L"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the name is a simple abbreviation, and if the term can be identified as a specific receptor or ligand, we should create a single word with an underscore. So for L, since the reference is EGF, which is the ligand, perhaps the term should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because the name for L is just ""L"", but the reference is EGF. So perhaps we should map ""L"" to ""EGF_L"".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- DiL00UU remains ""DiL00UU"" because there\'s no further info to map it to a more specific term.\n- Di00UU, with the reference EGFR, should be ""EGFR"".\n- L, with the reference EGF, should be ""EGF_L"".\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nWait, but looking at the example the user gave, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" because it\'s a receptor. So in this case, Di00UU is a receptor, so maybe it\'s better to map it as ""EGFR_R"" to clarify it\'s a receptor. Similarly, L as ""EGF_L"" for ligand.\n\nSo perhaps the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nBut the guidelines say if the name is already interpretable, don\'t make changes. So Di00UU is ""Di00UU"" in the name, but the reference is EGFR. So should I map it to ""EGFR"" or ""EGFR_R""? Since the role is a product, which is a modifier, perhaps it\'s the receptor, so ""EGFR_R"" makes sense.\n\nSimilarly, L is a ligand, so ""EGF_L"".\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""DiL00UU"": ""DiL00UU"",\n  ""Di00UU"": ""EGFR_R"",\n  ""L"": ""EGF_L""\n}\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, Di00UU is in the products and modifiers, and the reference is EGFR. So maybe it\'s better to map Di00UU to ""EGFR_R"" to indicate it\'s the receptor.\n\nBut the initial name is Di00UU, so I\'m not sure if that\'s an abbreviation for EGFR. If it is, then perhaps the mapping should be to the full term. But if Di00UU is a standard abbreviation, then perhaps it should remain as is. However, the guidelines say to use the name column if possible, but also to use references for accuracy. So I think mapping it to ""EGFR_R"" would be more accurate, indicating it\'s the receptor.\n\nSo I\'ll proceed with that.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c162 + c105 => c123. Each of these ids (c162, c105, c123) is listed in the replacement table with their names and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c162, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB2)_P. The references are empty. Since ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors, and there's a '_P' which might stand for phosphorylated, but according to the guidelines, I should connect receptor and ligand with an underscore. However, since both are receptors, maybe it's a dimer. So, I'll consider it as a complex. So, the term would be ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9. The references are also empty. ATP is a ligand, so I can directly use 'ATP' as it's already a known term. The number might be a concentration, but since the guidelines say if it's interpretable as-is, we don't change it. So, c105 maps to 'ATP'.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor, which is ErbB1. So the complex here includes EGF binding to ErbB1 and ErbB2. So, the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2. The ATP is part of the complex, but since the guidelines say to include states or specific ligands, maybe we should include ATP as well? Wait, but the product is the complex with ATP, so perhaps it's the active form. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe it's part of the term. However, the references for c123 are EGF and EGFR, so perhaps we should focus on the main components. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' is sufficient, or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP' but that seems too long. Since the product is the complex after binding ATP, perhaps we can consider the state as 'bound' or 'active'. But the guidelines say to include states like 'bound' or 'active' as part of the term with an underscore. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe it's just part of the complex, so the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But I need to check the guidelines again.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So for c162, it's a complex of two receptors, so maybe it's 'ErbB1_ErbB2'. For c123, it's a complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and ATP. But the references are EGF and EGFR (which is ErbB1). So perhaps the main components are EGF and ErbB1, but since ErbB2 is also present, we include it. So, the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'. The ATP might be part of the process but perhaps not part of the main term. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe we should include it. But the references don't mention ATP, so maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptor complex after binding ATP. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the product is the complex including ATP, perhaps the term is 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But that might be too long. Alternatively, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' because it's bound to ATP. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, it says to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. For c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and references are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps the main components are EGF and EGFR (ErbB1), but since ErbB2 is also part of the complex, we include it. So the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'. The ATP is part of the product, but perhaps it's the state, so maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. Alternatively, since ATP is a ligand, perhaps it's part of the complex, so 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\nWait, the guidelines also say that if the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, it's not recommended to make significant changes. So for c162, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB2)_P. Since it's a complex of two receptors, perhaps 'ErbB1_ErbB2' is the term. For c105, it's 'ATP'. For c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, so perhaps 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP' but that's four components. Alternatively, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' as the main complex, with ATP being part of the reaction but not necessarily part of the term. Or, considering that the product is the active form after binding ATP, perhaps 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'.\n\nBut I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. The equation is c162 + c105 => c123. So c162 is the receptor dimer (ErbB1 and ErbB2), and c105 is ATP. The product c123 is the complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and ATP. So, the term for c123 should represent this complex. The references for c123 are EGF and EGFR, so EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is ErbB1. So, the term should include EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. The ATP is part of the complex, but perhaps it's not necessary to include it in the term unless it's a state. Alternatively, maybe the term is 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' because it's bound to ATP, making it active.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the term should be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' since that's the main components, and the ATP is part of the process but not part of the term. Alternatively, perhaps 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP' is acceptable, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the name column and references contain synonyms, prioritize the name column. For c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, so perhaps we should include all components. But the references are EGF and EGFR, which are the main components. So, maybe the term is 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' as the complex, and the ATP is part of the state, so perhaps 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. Alternatively, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP' is the term.\n\nI think I'll go with 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' for c123, as the main components, and perhaps the ATP is part of the process but not part of the term. Alternatively, since the product includes ATP, maybe it's part of the term. But I'm not entirely certain. I think I'll proceed with 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' as the term for c123.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nc162: ErbB1_ErbB2\n\nc105: ATP\n\nc123: EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"", 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: x11 => x8. Then there\'s a replacement table with columns for role, id, name, and references. The table has two rows: one for reactants (x11) with name ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"", and another for products (x8) with name ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"".\n\nMy task is to map each id (x11 and x8) to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with x11. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". The references are EGF and EGFR. I notice that EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, the term should combine them. Since it\'s the reactant, maybe it\'s the unbound form. So, I\'ll map x11 to ""EGF_L"" because it\'s the ligand before binding.\n\nNow, for x8, the name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" and the references are EGFR and EGF. This seems like the bound form because of the asterisk, which often denotes a bound state in biological equations. So, this would be the receptor-ligand complex. Therefore, I\'ll map x8 to ""EGFR_R_active"" since it\'s the active receptor after binding with the ligand.\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word. ""EGF_L"" and ""EGFR_R_active"" both fit that criterion. I also considered if there\'s a simpler way to represent these, but given the guidelines, combining them with underscores is appropriate.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the guidelines: using single words, combining receptor and ligand with underscores, including the state (active) when necessary, and not making unnecessary changes when the terms are already interpretable. I also made sure to prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency.\n\nSo, the final JSON object should map x11 to ""EGF_L"" and x8 to ""EGFR_R_active"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. The user wants each term to be a single word. If there\'s an ambiguous term, I need to replace it with something more specific using the replacement table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column over \'references\' for consistency. Finally, the output should be a JSON object without any extra comments.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x8 => x87. The replacement table has two rows:\n\n1. reactants: x8 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"" with references EGFR and EGF.\n2. products: x87 maps to ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" with no references.\n\nI need to process each id (x8 and x87) and map them to the correct terms.\n\nStarting with x8:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"". The references are EGFR and EGF. I know that EGFR is the receptor and EGF is the ligand. The \'i\' likely stands for \'inhibitor\', and the \'*^2\' might be a subscript indicating a dimer or something similar. Since the name isn\'t a single word, I need to make it one. Combining the ligand and receptor with an underscore makes sense. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand and ""EGFR"" is the receptor. The ""i*^2"" part could refer to an inhibited dimer. Maybe I can represent this as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is too long. Alternatively, maybe it\'s better to simplify. Since ""EGF-EGFRi"" might mean EGF bound to an inhibited EGFR, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". But the ""*^2"" might indicate a dimer, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". Hmm, but the user wants a single word, so I need to combine them without spaces. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" as a single term, but that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R_active"", so it\'s about state. So maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" is better, and the ""*^2"" could be ""dimer"" but that\'s another state. Alternatively, maybe the user wants to keep the format as per the name, so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"". The ""*^2"" might be a superscript indicating a dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable, but I\'m not sure if it\'s too long. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_i"" with the understanding that \'i\' stands for inhibited. But the user\'s guidelines say to avoid making significant changes if the term is already interpretable. The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", which might be a shorthand. So maybe the best approach is to convert ""EGF-EGFRi"" into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and the ""*^2"" as ""dimer"", so combining them as ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". But that\'s a bit long, but it\'s a single word.\n\nNow for x87:\n- The name is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"". The \'deg\' likely stands for \'degradation\' or \'degenerate\', but in biological terms, it\'s more about degradation. So the process is the degradation product of the inhibited dimer. So following the same logic as x8, we can take ""EGF-EGFRi*^2deg"" and convert it into ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"" or ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded_dimer"". But again, it\'s a single word. Alternatively, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_deg"" but \'deg\' is not as clear. Perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"" is better, indicating the state of being degraded.\n\nWait, but the references for x8 include EGFR and EGF, so the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So in the name, ""EGF-EGFRi"" is the ligand-receptor complex, where the receptor is inhibited. The ""*^2"" is a dimer, so two receptors. So perhaps the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited"". For x87, it\'s the same but degraded, so ""EGF_EGFR_dimer_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", which is a single word with the state. So maybe for x8, the term is ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and for x87, it\'s ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the \'i\' in the name stands for \'inhibited\', so ""EGF-EGFRi"" becomes ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"", and the ""*^2"" is a dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". Then x87, being the degradation product, would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure if \'dimer\' is necessary, or if it\'s implied. Maybe the user just wants ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited"" and ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_degraded"".\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example uses ""IL6_R_active"", which combines the ligand and receptor with an underscore and then the state. So for x8, since it\'s a reactant, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the product, which is the degradation product, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t include the dimer part, so maybe I should consider whether the dimer is necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the ""*^2"" is a subscript indicating a dimer, so it\'s part of the term. So ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the ""*^2"" is a reference to a specific form, but since the user wants a single word, I need to include it. So perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" is acceptable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object would map x8 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"" and x87 to ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""IL6_R_active"", so perhaps the format is ligand_receptor_state. So for x8, it\'s the inhibited dimer, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer"". For x87, it\'s the degraded form, so ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the \'deg\' in x87\'s name stands for \'degraded\', so the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inhibited_dimer_degraded"".\n\nI think that\'s the approach to take.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object mapping each id in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how to approach this.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the guidelines. Each term should be a single word. If it's a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, R becomes IL6_R. I need to make sure I'm using the right context and references for accurate substitutions. Sometimes it's a two-step process: first map id to name, then refine with references.\n\nThe input includes an equation and a replacement table. The equation is c149 + c105 => c127. The replacement table has three entries with roles, ids, names, and references.\n\nStarting with c149: the name is (ErbB1:ErbB3)_P. The references column is empty here. Since it's a complex, I think I should combine ErbB1 and ErbB3 with underscores. The '_P' might indicate phosphorylation, so maybe include 'active' as a state. So, it becomes ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nNext, c105: the name is ATP 1.2e9, which seems like a concentration. The references are empty. Since it's just ATP, and it's a common term, I can keep it as ATP without changes.\n\nLastly, c127: the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3:ATP, and the references are EGF; EGFR. The name is a bit complex, but the references point to EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is a receptor. So combining them, it would be EGF_L for ligand and EGFR_R for receptor. Including ATP, but since it's already a product, maybe it's part of the complex. However, the guidelines say to use the name column first, so I think the term should be EGF_L_EGFR_R.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object maps each id to its corresponding term. I think that's it."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c163 + c105 => c124. There are three ids here: c163, c105, and c124. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c163. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB3)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB3 is HER3. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be a single word combining these. Since both are receptors, I can write them as EGFR_HER3_P. That makes sense because it\'s a complex of EGFR and HER3 in a phosphorylated state.\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"". The number seems to be a concentration or something, but the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"" as the term.\n\nFor c124, the name is ""(EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3):ATP"" and the references include EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term should combine the ligand and receptors. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the complex is EGF bound to EGFR and HER3 (ErbB3). So, the term should be EGF_EGFR_HER3_ATP. This includes the ligand, both receptors, and the ATP.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, considering the state like active or bound is important, but in this case, the name doesn\'t specify a state beyond the presence of ATP. So, combining them as such should suffice.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON will have keys c163, c105, and c124 with their respective terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: R + EGF => Ra. Then there\'s a replacement table with four columns: role, id, name, and references. The table has three entries for reactants and one for products.\n\nThe first thing I notice is the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON should be a single word. So I need to make sure each id is mapped to a term that\'s concise. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For R, the name is EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. So R stands for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. Since it\'s a receptor, I should connect it with an underscore. So R becomes ""EGFR_R"".\n  \n- EGF\'s name is Epidermal_Growth_Factor, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I need to append ""_L"" to it. So EGF becomes ""EGF_L"".\n\n- Ra\'s name is EGF_EGFR, and the references are EGFR and EGF. This is a product, so it\'s the bound form of the receptor and ligand. I should combine them with an underscore and add ""_bound"" to indicate the state. So Ra becomes ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nI should also check if any two-step process is needed. For example, mapping from id to name first and then refining. In this case, R maps directly to EGFR, which is a receptor, so no further refinement is needed beyond adding ""_R"". Similarly, EGF maps directly to its name, so adding ""_L"" suffices.\n\nI need to ensure that I\'m not making unnecessary changes if the term is already interpretable. For example, if an id is ""IL6"", I wouldn\'t change it unless there\'s a more specific term in the references.\n\nAlso, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the \'name\' column if there are synonyms. In this case, all the names are pretty straightforward, so that\'s fine.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the cases. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure each key is the id and the value is the corresponding term with the appropriate suffixes.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the input includes an equation: L_EGFR => L_EGFR_dimer. There\'s also a replacement table with two rows. Both have the same references: EGF; EGFR. The first row has id L_EGFR with no name, and the second has id L_EGFR_dimer also with no name.\n\nThe guidelines say each term in the JSON must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, the ids are L_EGFR and L_EGFR_dimer.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, both ids have references to EGF and EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, and EGF is a ligand, I think L refers to the ligand. So L_EGFR would be EGF, and L_EGFR_dimer would be the dimer form of EGF.\n\nWait, but the id is L_EGFR, so maybe it\'s the ligand for EGFR, which is EGF. So the term should be EGF_L. But the guidelines say if it\'s a simple receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. So L would be the ligand, so EGF_L. Similarly, the dimer would be EGF_L_dimer.\n\nBut the equation shows L_EGFR converting to L_EGFR_dimer, so in the JSON, each id needs to map to a term. So for L_EGFR, the term is EGF_L, and for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s EGF_L_dimer.\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word, so combining with underscores is okay. Also, I should prioritize the \'name\' column if available, but here it\'s empty, so I rely on the references.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map L_EGFR to ""EGF_L"" and L_EGFR_dimer to ""EGF_L_dimer"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Then there\'s a replacement table with three rows. The \'id\'s are Rp, Shc, and Rp_Shc. The \'name\' column for Rp is empty, but the references say EGF and EGFR. Shc\'s name and references are empty, but the product Rp_Shc has a reference to EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with Rp. The \'id\' is Rp, the \'name\' is empty, but the reference is EGF and EGFR. I need to map Rp to a single word. Since EGF is a ligand and EGFR is the receptor, Rp likely stands for the receptor. So, Rp should be mapped to EGFR.\n\nNext, Shc. The \'id\' is Shc, and both \'name\' and references are empty. Shc is a known adaptor protein in signaling pathways, often associated with receptors like EGFR. Since there\'s no reference, I\'ll use Shc as-is, but maybe it can be more specific. However, since the guidelines say if it\'s reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it. So Shc remains Shc.\n\nThen, Rp_Shc. The product\'s \'id\' is Rp_Shc, and the reference is EGFR. So, since Rp is EGFR, and Shc is the adaptor, Rp_Shc would be the complex of EGFR and Shc. Therefore, it should be EGFR_Shc.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if it\'s a two-step process, first map the \'id\' to \'name\' using the table, then refine using references. For Rp, since the \'name\' is empty, I have to rely on the references, which are EGF and EGFR. So Rp is the receptor, which is EGFR. So Rp becomes EGFR.\n\nShc has no \'name\' or references, so I leave it as Shc.\n\nRp_Shc, from the product, the reference is EGFR.

The ""i^2"" might indicate a dimer or a complex in a different state. Since it\'s the product after the reaction, maybe it\'s the active form.

I\'m also checking if the terms are already interpretable.

That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any receptors or ligands listed in the ""name"" column. The IDs are bEGFR, PI3K, bEGFR, and pPI3K. The names are boundEGFR and PI3K. The references for bEGFR are EGFR and EGF, which are the receptor and ligand. So maybe I need to use those references to figure out the receptor and ligand terms.\n\nThey also mentioned considering states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and including them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". In the replacement table, the names include ""boundEGFR"", so maybe that\'s a state. \n\nLooking at the input equation: bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. So the reactants are boundEGFR and PI3K, and the products are the same boundEGFR and phosphorylated PI3K. \n\nThe replacement table has bEGFR mapped to boundEGFR, which refers to EGFR (the receptor) and EGF (the ligand). So perhaps bEGFR is the bound form of EGFR, meaning the receptor is bound by EGF. Therefore, the term could be ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nFor PI3K, the name is PI3K, and there\'s no reference. Since it\'s a kinase, maybe it\'s just ""PI3K"" as it is. The products have pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K, so that would be ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nWait, but the user said if a term is a simple abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. So PI3K is fine as is, but pPI3K should become ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. For bEGFR, since it\'s bound, it\'s ""EGFR_bound"". PI3K stays as ""PI3K"". pPI3K becomes ""PI3K_phosphorylated"".\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything.

Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". The replacement table has ""bEGFR"" in the reactants with the name ""boundEGFR"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"". The products have ""null"" for both name and references.\n\nHmm, so the input equation is bEGFR => null. That suggests that bEGFR is transforming into something, but the product is null. But in the replacement table, the product\'s id is null, which probably means it\'s an empty product, like nothing is produced. So, in the JSON, the key is ""bEGFR"" and the value should be the interpretable term.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, for id ""bEGFR"", the name is ""boundEGFR"".

""bEGFR"" is an abbreviation for bound EGFR, but the name column says ""boundEGFR"". So, should I use ""boundEGFR"" or ""bEGFR""? Since the name is provided as ""boundEGFR"", which is more descriptive, I should use that. It\'s more biologically interpretable than the abbreviation.\n\nAlso, the references include ""EGF; EGFR"". That means EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor. So, the term ""boundEGFR"" implies that EGFR is bound by EGF. So, perhaps I should combine them. Like ""EGF_EGFR_bound""? But that\'s more than one word when combined with underscores. Wait, no, ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is still a single term with underscores, so it\'s acceptable.\n\nBut the guidelines say if a receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So, since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, the term could be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"". But in the replacement table, the name is ""boundEGFR"", which is a single word. So, maybe I should stick with ""boundEGFR"" as it\'s already provided and more concise.\n\nAlternatively, considering the references, maybe I should represent it as ""EGF_bound_EGFR"" or something similar, but that would be three parts, which might be too long. The guidelines prefer single words, so perhaps ""boundEGFR"" is sufficient.\n\nWait, but the guidelines also mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine with references. So, first, ""bEGFR"" maps to ""boundEGFR"". Then, looking at references, EGF is the ligand, EGFR is the receptor. So, perhaps the more accurate term is ""EGF_bound_EGFR"", but that\'s three parts. Alternatively, ""EGFR_bound_by_EGF"", but that\'s four parts.\n\nHmm, maybe the simplest way is to use the name provided, ""boundEGFR"", since it\'s already a single word and clearly indicates that EGFR is in a bound state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should map ""bEGFR"" to ""boundEGFR"" and ""null"" to ""null"".

Let me examine the table:\n\n- Role: reactants, id: R, name: (empty), references: (empty)\n- Role: reactants, id: EGF, name: EGF, references: EGF\n- Role: products, id: RE, name: (empty), references: EGFR; EGF\n\nHmm, so for R, the name is empty, and references are also empty. EGF has name EGF and references EGF. RE has an empty name but references EGFR and EGF.\n\nThe equation suggests that R and EGF combine to form RE. In biology, EGF typically stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, R is likely the receptor for EGF, which would be EGFR. So, R is EGFR, and when it binds to EGF, the product is the receptor-ligand complex, which would be EGFR_EGF.\n\nBut wait, the replacement table for RE has references EGFR and EGF, so the product is the combination of both. Therefore, the id RE should map to EGFR_EGF.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- R: Since it\'s the receptor for EGF, it\'s EGFR.\n- EGF: It\'s already a standard term, so it stays EGF.\n- RE: The product is the receptor and ligand together, so EGFR_EGF.\n\nI need to ensure each is a single word, so EGFR_EGF works as it\'s one term connected by an underscore.\n\nI should also check if any states like ""active"" or ""bound"" are needed, but the references don\'t mention that, so I\'ll stick with the base terms.\n\nFinally, I\'ll structure this into a JSON object with the ids as keys and the terms as values.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"".

The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as the free form of the EGFR receptor. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is unless necessary. However, since the name is freeEGFR, it\'s more precise to use the full term. But wait, the guideline says if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s better not to change it. So maybe fEGFR should just be ""EGFR"" because the name is freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. Hmm, perhaps ""EGFR_free"" or ""EGFR"" itself. But the replacement table\'s name is freeEGFR, which might suggest it\'s the free form, but in the guidelines, if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. So I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\' is fEGFR, and the \'name\' is freeEGFR. The reference is EGFR. So maybe I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is just a state. But according to the guidelines, if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t make changes. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, but perhaps it\'s better to use the full term. But the guidelines say not to make significant changes if the term is an abbreviation or is interpretable. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. So perhaps the correct term is ""EGFR"".\n\nThen EGF. The \'id\' is EGF, the \'name\' is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, and the name is EGF, which is a common abbreviation, it\'s better to keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The \'id\' is bEGFR, the \'name\' is boundEGFR, and the references are EGF and EGFR. So this is the bound form of the EGFR receptor. According to the guidelines, if we can identify the receptor, we should combine it with an underscore. So maybe ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_EGF"" since EGF is the ligand. But the guidelines say to consider states like ""bound"" as part of the term, so ""EGFR_bound"" might be appropriate. Alternatively, ""EGFR_EGF"" could indicate the complex. However, the name is boundEGFR, which suggests the state, so ""EGFR_bound"" seems fitting.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"", EGF to ""EGF"", and bEGFR to ""EGFR_bound"". That seems to align with the guidelines, using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and considering the states where applicable.\n\nI think that\'s the approach. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column, so for fEGFR, the name is freeEGFR, but the reference is EGFR. So perhaps I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is a state. Similarly, bEGFR is boundEGFR, so ""EGFR_bound"". EGF is straightforward as it\'s the ligand.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". The replacement table has ""bEGFR"" in the reactants with the name ""boundEGFR"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"". The products have ""null"" for both name and references.\n\nHmm, so the input equation is bEGFR => null. I need to map \'bEGFR\' to a biologically interpretable term. The replacement table says the name for \'bEGFR\' is \'boundEGFR\'. The references are \'EGFR\' and \'EGF\'. \n\nSince the name is \'boundEGFR\', that suggests it\'s the bound form of the EGF Receptor. In biology, EGFR is a receptor, and when it\'s bound, it\'s often referred to as being active or bound by its ligand, which is EGF. So the term should reflect that it\'s the receptor in a bound state.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, I should create a single word by combining the receptor name with the state. So ""boundEGFR"" can be ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"" since it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since the name is ""boundEGFR"", maybe it\'s more accurate to keep it as ""boundEGFR"" because it\'s already a single word and biologically interpretable.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if the term is already interpretable, don\'t change it. So ""boundEGFR"" is a single word and makes sense biologically, so I shouldn\'t change it. The references are ""EGFR; EGF"", which are the receptor and ligand, but since the name is ""boundEGFR"", it\'s probably better to stick with that.\n\nFor the \'null\' id, the name is \'null\' and references are empty. So in the JSON, it should map to \'null\' as well. So the JSON would be {""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"", ""null"": ""null""}.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach. I\'m not sure if I should consider the state as an underscore or if ""boundEGFR"" is sufficient. Since the name is already ""boundEGFR"", I don\'t need to make any changes. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s interpretable, so that\'s the way to go.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as an excellent biological researcher. They\'ve given me a task to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down what I need to do.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the guidelines thoroughly. Each term must be a single word. If the term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that as part of the term with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries. Let me go through each row.\n\nFor the first row, the `id` is fEGFR, the `name` is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since it\'s a reactant and the name is freeEGFR, which is an abbreviation, I think ""freeEGFR"" is already a single word and biologically interpretable, so I can keep it as is.\n\nThe second row has `id` EGF, `name` EGF, and references EGF. Since EGF is a well-known ligand, and it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. It\'s straightforward.\n\nThe third row has `id` bEGFR, `name` boundEGFR, and references EGFR; EGF. Here, the name is boundEGFR, which indicates the state of the receptor. So, combining the receptor (EGFR) with the state (bound) gives us ""EGFR_bound"".\n\nI should check if any two-step process is needed. For fEGFR, the name is freeEGFR, which is already clear, so no further mapping is needed. Similarly, EGF is clear. For bEGFR, the name is boundEGFR, so I can map it directly without needing additional references beyond what\'s provided.\n\nI should also ensure that I\'m not adding any unnecessary changes. Since the guidelines say if the term is already interpretable, I shouldn\'t alter it. So, ""EGFR"" is already a standard term, and adding ""bound"" as a state makes it more precise.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should have the keys as the `id`s and the values as the biologically interpretable terms. That would be:\n\n{\n  ""fEGFR"": ""freeEGFR"",\n  ""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n  ""bEGFR"": ""EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines and the input provided. I don\'t see any need for further changes or additional steps. Each term is a single word, and where necessary, states are included with underscores.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have phrases; I need to condense things into one word, possibly using underscores. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include those as part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four entries, each with an id, name, and references. The roles are either reactants or products.\n\nFor the first entry, id is bEGFR, name is boundEGFR, and the references point to EGFR and EGF. According to the guidelines, if the name is already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So, I can map bEGFR to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nNext, PI3K\'s name is PI3K, and the references include some URNs, but the name is straightforward. Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"".\n\nThe third entry is also bEGFR, same as the first one. So, it maps to ""boundEGFR"".\n\nThe last id is pPI3K, name is pPI3K, references include some URNs. Again, the name is straightforward, so I\'ll map it to ""pPI3K"".\n\nI should also consider if any of these terms need to be split into receptor or ligand. For example, if there was an \'R\' or \'L\' suffix, I would connect them with an underscore. But in this case, the ids are already in a format that\'s biologically meaningful without needing that step.\n\nI don\'t see any need for a two-step process here since the names are directly interpretable. Also, none of the terms require adding states like ""bound"" or ""active"" beyond what\'s already in the name.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its corresponding name as they are, since they meet the criteria of being single words and are already biologically interpretable.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c159 + c105 => c123. Each of these ids (c159, c105, c123) is listed in the replacement table with their names and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c159, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2) and references are EGF; EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since the guidelines suggest using receptor and ligand names, perhaps I should combine them. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""? But wait, the example given in the guidelines uses an underscore, like IL6_R or CSF1R_L. Hmm, but in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So perhaps it\'s better to write it as EGF_ligand with receptors. But the example shows R and L as suffixes, so maybe EGF as L and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as R. Wait, but the name is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So perhaps the term should represent the complex. Since it\'s a complex, maybe just using the components. But the guidelines say to use single words. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" is acceptable.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP with a value 1.2e9, but the references are empty. So it\'s just ATP, which is a molecule. Since it\'s a standard term, we can leave it as ATP.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and references are EGF; EGFR. So this is the product after ATP binds to the complex. So perhaps it\'s the ATP-bound form. The guidelines suggest including states like bound or active. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound""? But the name already includes ATP, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as the complex with ATP. Alternatively, since ATP is a ligand, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP. But the guidelines say if it\'s a ligand, use an underscore, so perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the guidelines, the example was R and L as suffixes. But in this case, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So maybe c159 should be EGF (ligand) and the receptors as ErbB1 and ErbB2. But the name is a complex, so perhaps it\'s better to represent it as EGF bound to the receptors. But the term needs to be a single word. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" for c159, ""ATP"" for c105, and ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" for c123.\n\nWait, but in the example, the output was ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps for c159, since it\'s the ligand and receptors, it\'s EGF (ligand) and ErbB1 and ErbB2 as receptors. But how to represent that in a single word? Maybe ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB2_R""? But that\'s a bit long and might not be necessary. Alternatively, perhaps just ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" as a complex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the complex is the receptor dimer, so ErbB1 and ErbB2 form a heterodimer bound to EGF. So the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_receptor_complex"" but that\'s more than a single word. Hmm, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. So perhaps we can combine them with underscores without the word \'receptor\' or \'ligand\' unless necessary.\n\nWait, in the example, the output for c159 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"" and for c123 was ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"". So perhaps that\'s the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together:\n\n{\n  ""c159"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c123"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about c123. Should it be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound_ATP"" or just include ATP as part of the complex? The guidelines mention including states like bound, so maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" would be better. But the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, so it\'s the complex with ATP. So perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"" is sufficient.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP_bound"" to indicate the state. But the guidelines say to use the name column as priority, so since the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, maybe it\'s better to include ATP as part of the term without adding \'bound\' unless necessary.\n\nI think the initial approach is correct. So the JSON would be as above.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c11, c105, and c126. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and some references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c11 has the name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references ""EGF; ATP; EGFR"". The guidelines say that if we can identify a receptor or ligand, we should combine them with an underscore. Here, EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, which is also known as EGFR. So, EGF binds to EGFR. Since ATP is part of the complex, but it\'s an enzyme component, maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s activity. So, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c105 has the name ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references. The name is a bit ambiguous because it\'s just ATP with a number. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as is. So, I\'ll map c105 to ""ATP"" since it\'s already a known term.\n\nFor c126, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1):ATP"" with references ""EGF; EGFR"". Again, EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor (EGFR). The "":ATP"" might indicate the receptor\'s active state with ATP bound. So, combining them and adding the state, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have c11 as ""EGF_EGFR"", c105 as ""ATP"", and c126 as ""EGF_EGFR_active"".', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: c148 + c105 => c122. There are three ids here: c148, c105, and c122. Each has a name and references in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c148. The name is ""(ErbB1:ErbB2)_P"". I know that ErbB1 is another name for EGFR (Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor), and ErbB2 is HER2. The ""_P"" might stand for phosphorylated. So, the term should be something like ""EGFR:HER2_phosphorylated"". I\'ll use underscores to combine them as per the guidelines.\n\nNext, c105. The name is ""ATP  1.2e9"". Hmm, ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate, a common molecule. The number might be a concentration, but since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So, I\'ll just use ""ATP"".\n\nThen, c122. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2:ATP"" and references include EGF and EGFR. Since ErbB1 is EGFR, the term can be simplified. So, it\'s ""EGF:EGFR:HER2:ATP"".\n\nWait, I should check if there are any states like bound or active. The c148 has _P, which I interpreted as phosphorylated. But the guidelines mention using states like ""bound"" or ""active"". Maybe ""phosphorylated"" is acceptable as a state. So I think I\'m okay there.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. Let me structure that.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c150 + c105 => c128. Each of these ids (c150, c105, c128) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c150, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB4. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB4_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the name is simply ATP. The references are empty. Since ATP is a well-known molecule, I don\'t need to change it. So, the term is just ATP.\n\nLastly, c128 has the name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB4:ATP and references EGF; EGFR. The role is product. Here, EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. The guidelines suggest adding states like ""active"" as part of the term. So, combining these, it would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.\n\nI should ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. Also, prioritize the name column for consistency. So, the final JSON should have c150 mapped to ErbB1_ErbB4_P, c105 to ATP, and c128 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"".

The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as the free form of the EGFR receptor. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is unless necessary. However, since the name is freeEGFR, it\'s more precise to use the full term. But wait, the guideline says if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s better not to change it. So maybe fEGFR should just be ""EGFR"" because the name is freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. Hmm, perhaps ""EGFR_free"" or ""EGFR"" itself. But the replacement table\'s name is freeEGFR, which might suggest it\'s the free form, but in the guidelines, if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. So I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\' is fEGFR, and the \'name\' is freeEGFR. The reference is EGFR. So maybe I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is just a state. But according to the guidelines, if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t make changes. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, but perhaps it\'s better to use the full term. But the guidelines say not to make significant changes if the term is an abbreviation or is interpretable. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. So perhaps the correct term is ""EGFR"".\n\nThen EGF. The \'id\' is EGF, the \'name\' is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, and the name is EGF, which is a common abbreviation, it\'s better to keep it as ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The \'id\' is bEGFR, the \'name\' is boundEGFR, and the references are EGF and EGFR. So this is the bound form of the EGFR receptor. According to the guidelines, if we can identify the receptor, we should combine it with an underscore. So maybe ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_EGF"" since EGF is the ligand. But the guidelines say to consider states like ""bound"" as part of the term, so ""EGFR_bound"" might be appropriate. Alternatively, ""EGFR_EGF"" could indicate the complex. However, the name is boundEGFR, which suggests the state, so ""EGFR_bound"" seems fitting.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"", EGF to ""EGF"", and bEGFR to ""EGFR_bound"". That seems to align with the guidelines, using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and considering the states where applicable.\n\nI think that\'s the approach. Let me make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column, so for fEGFR, the name is freeEGFR, but the reference is EGFR. So perhaps I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is a state. Similarly, bEGFR is boundEGFR, so ""EGFR_bound"". EGF is straightforward as it\'s the ligand.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""fEGFR"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""EGF"": ""EGF"",\n  ""bEGFR"": ""EGFR_bound""\n}', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c3 + c140 => c146. There\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. Sometimes, I might need to go through a two-step process: first map id to name, then refine using references.\n\nLooking at the first row: role is reactants, id is c3, name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, and references are EGF; ATP; EGFR. So, I need to break down EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor. So, maybe EGF_L and ErbB1_R. But wait, the name has three parts: EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. Hmm, ATP is a molecule, but maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s active state. So, perhaps ErbB1 is the receptor, and since it\'s bound with ATP, maybe it\'s in an active state. So, I can combine them as ErbB1_R_active.\n\nNext, c140: role reactants, id c140, name ErbB3, no references. Since it\'s just ErbB3, which is a receptor, I can write it as ErbB3_R.\n\nThen, c146: role products, name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, references EGF; EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. So, EGF_L and the receptors as ErbB1_R and ErbB3_R. But in the products, they are combined. Wait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3. So, maybe it\'s EGF bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB3 receptors. So, perhaps EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R, but that\'s more than one word. Wait, the guideline says each term must be a single word. Hmm, but this might be a complex, so maybe I can combine them as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the product is the active form of the receptors bound to EGF, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nWait, but the product id is c146, so I need to map it to a single term. Maybe I can think of it as a ternary complex. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, so perhaps I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3, but that\'s still multiple words. Alternatively, maybe it\'s an active state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect with an underscore. So, maybe EGF is the ligand, so EGF_L, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors, so ErbB1_R and ErbB3_R. But in the products, they are all together, so perhaps the term is EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R. But that\'s four words. Wait, but each term in the JSON should be a single word. So, maybe I need to combine them into a single term, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3 or EGF_ErbB1R_ErbB3R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptors after binding EGF, so maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1R_ErbB3R_active. But that\'s multiple words. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the references. For c3, the references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. So, EGFR is another name for ErbB1. So, perhaps EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is part of the active state. So, c3 could be EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active, which is a single term with underscores.\n\nFor c140, it\'s ErbB3, so just ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, and references include EGF and EGFR. So, EGFR is ErbB1. So, c146 is the product of EGF binding to ErbB1 and ErbB3. So, perhaps EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R. But again, that\'s four words. Wait, maybe I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_R, but that\'s still multiple words. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s an active complex, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nBut I\'m supposed to make each term a single word. So, maybe I need to combine them into a single string with underscores, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. So, perhaps for c3, since it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which implies the ligand EGF is bound to the receptor ErbB1 with ATP, which might indicate the active state. So, I can write it as EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active.\n\nFor c140, it\'s just ErbB3, so ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146, it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, so perhaps the active form where EGF is bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB3, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active. But that\'s a long term, but it\'s a single word with underscores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can simplify it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s the best approach. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the references to see if there\'s a more specific term. The references for c146 include EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1. So, maybe the product is the active form of ErbB1 and ErbB3 bound to EGF, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure if that\'s the correct way to represent it as a single term. Maybe it\'s better to represent it as a complex, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to consider states like bound or active. So, perhaps c146 is the active form, so I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident. Maybe I should go step by step.\n\nFor c3: EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is part of the active state. So, EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active.\n\nFor c140: ErbB3, so ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146: EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3. So, it\'s the combination of EGF with both ErbB1 and ErbB3. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form where EGF is bound to both receptors. So, EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nBut that\'s a long term, but it\'s a single word with underscores. Alternatively, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So, the JSON would map c3 to ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active"", c140 to ""ErbB3_R"", and c146 to ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if a term is a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. So, maybe I should check if EGF is an abbreviation. EGF stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, which is a ligand, so it\'s better to write it as EGF_L.\n\nSimilarly, ErbB1 is a receptor, so ErbB1_R.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active"",\n  ""c140"": ""ErbB3_R"",\n  ""c146"": ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best I can do based on the guidelines.', '', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Each of these has an entry in the replacement table.\n\nStarting with c5. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1)_P. The reference column is empty, so I don\'t have any additional info. EGF is epidermal growth factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor. The _P might stand for phosphorylated. So, I think the term should combine EGF and ErbB1 with the state. Maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_P"".\n\nNext is c105. The name is ATP with a concentration value, 1.2e9. The reference is empty. ATP is adenosine triphosphate, a common molecule, so maybe just ""ATP"" is sufficient. The number is just a concentration, not part of the term.\n\nFinally, c116. The name is 2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive, and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGFR is another name for ErbB1, so it\'s consistent. The term includes EGF, ErbB1, ATP, and it\'s in the full active state. So, I need to combine these into a single term. Since it\'s active, I can add ""_active"" at the end. So, ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c5 to ""EGF_ErbB1_P"", c105 to ""ATP"", and c116 to ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP_active"".', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c164, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB4)_P. The role is reactant. The references column is empty. I need to interpret this. The guidelines say that if it's a receptor or ligand, I should use an underscore. So, ErbB1 is a receptor, as is ErbB4. The _P probably stands for phosphorylated. So, the term should be ErbB1_ErbB4_P.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a value of 1.2e9. The role is reactant, and the references are empty.

EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB4 are receptors. So, the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB4, along with ATP. Since it's a product, it might be the active form. So, the term could be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4_ATP_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines suggest that if states like active or bound are present, they should be included.

The references are empty, so I\'ll focus on the name. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor, also known as EGFR. The ""_P"" probably stands for phosphorylation.

Therefore, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_inactive"".\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word, connected by underscores. I\'m not changing the terms if they\'re already interpretable, but I\'m adding the state where necessary.

For x11, the name is EGF-EGFRi^2, with the same references.\n\nI need to map each id (x10 and x11) to a biologically interpretable term. Starting with x10: the name is EGF-EGFRi. I know that EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, and EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor. The \'i\' might stand for \'inhibitor\', so EGF-EGFRi could mean EGF bound to the EGFR inhibitor. But according to the guidelines, if I can identify the receptor and ligand specifically, I should combine them with an underscore. Since EGFR is the receptor for EGF, maybe x10 is the ligand (EGF) bound to the receptor (EGFR). But the name has \'i\' which complicates things. Alternatively, maybe it\'s the inhibited form.\n\nWait, the references are EGFR and EGF. So perhaps x10 is EGF bound to EGFR, forming a complex. So the term would be EGF_EGFR. But the name is EGF-EGFRi, so maybe it\'s the inhibited complex. However, the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay. But the name is already a bit specific, so maybe I should just combine EGF and EGFR as EGF_EGFR.\n\nFor x11, the name is EGF-EGFRi^2, which might indicate a dimer or a complex with two units. So perhaps it\'s the active or bound state. Maybe EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_active. But the guidelines suggest including states with an underscore, so maybe EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, considering the equation x10 => x11, it\'s likely a reaction where EGF binds to EGFR, forming a complex, and then maybe dimerizes or becomes active. So x10 might be the initial binding (EGF_EGFR), and x11 is the active form (EGF_EGFR_active).\n\nWait, but the references for both are the same, so I should prioritize the name column. For x10, the name is EGF-EGFRi, which might be the inhibited form. But without more context, it\'s safer to assume it\'s the receptor-ligand complex. So I\'ll map x10 to EGF_EGFR and x11 to EGF_EGFR_active.\n\nBut wait, the name for x11 is EGF-EGFRi^2, which might imply a dimer. So perhaps it\'s EGF_EGFR_dimer or EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nAlternatively, considering that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. So for x10, the name is EGF-EGFRi, which I can interpret as EGF bound to EGFR inhibitor. But perhaps it\'s more accurate to see it as EGF bound to EGFR, making it EGF_EGFR. Similarly, x11 is EGF-EGFRi^2, which could be the dimer form, so EGF_EGFR_bound.\n\nI think the key is to use the name as the primary source, but also consider the references.

Since the names are specific, I should use them as is but adjust for biological accuracy. So for x10, EGF-EGFRi becomes EGF_EGFR. For x11, EGF-EGFRi^2 becomes EGF_EGFR_bound or active.\n\nI think the best approach is to make x10 EGF_EGFR and x11 EGF_EGFR_bound, indicating the transition from binding to a bound state.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

But since it\'s a dimer, maybe EGF_ErbB1_dimer. Alternatively, if it\'s just the bound form, EGF_ErbB1_bound. The problem is the name is (EGF-ErbB1)2, so it\'s a dimer of the EGF-ErbB1 complex. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_dimer.\n\nFor E11P, the name is E11_p, and reference is EGFR. E11_p might stand for E11 phosphorylated. So maybe EGFR_p.\n\nFor SigT, the name is Sig-PTP-1B, and references are empty. So that\'s Sigma PTP-1B, which is an enzyme. So the id is SigT, so maybe we can use Sig_PTP-1B. But the name is Sig-PTP-1B, so perhaps Sig_PTP1B as a single word, or Sig_PTP1B_enzyme? But the guidelines say to use single words, so Sig_PTP1B.\n\nWait, the example uses IL6_R and CSF1R_L, so maybe for SigT, since it\'s a modifier, perhaps it\'s a phosphatase, so Sig_PTP1B.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\nE11 -> EGF_ErbB1_dimer or EGF_ErbB1_bound\nE11P -> EGFR_p\nSigT -> Sig_PTP1B\n\nBut wait, the references for E11 include EGFR and EGF.

EGF has name EGF and references EGF. RE has an empty name but references EGFR and EGF.\n\nThe equation suggests that R and EGF combine to form RE. In biology, EGF typically stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So, R is likely the receptor for EGF, which would be EGFR.

If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" for a receptor. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included by adding them with an underscore. If the term is already simple, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is species_0 => species_25 + species_1, which probably represents a chemical reaction where species_0 is converted into species_25 and species_1.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries:\n- species_0: role is reactant, name is pEGFR, reference is EGFR.\n- species_25: role is product, name is EGF, reference is EGF.\n- species_1: role is product, name is free_EGFR, reference is EGFR.\n\nMy task is to map each id to a biologically accurate term.\n\nStarting with species_0: The name is pEGFR, which likely stands for phosphorylated EGFR. The reference is just EGFR, so maybe I should use the phosphorylated form since that\'s more specific. So, I\'ll map species_0 to ""EGFR phosphorylated"" but as a single word: ""EGFR_phosphorylated"".\n\nNext, species_25: The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s already a single word and well-known, I don\'t need to change it. So species_25 maps to ""EGF"".\n\nFor species_1: The name is free_EGFR, and the reference is EGFR. The term ""free"" indicates that the receptor is not bound. To make it a single word, I\'ll use ""EGFR_free"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. In this case, EGFR is a receptor, so maybe I should include ""R"" for receptor. So species_0 could be ""EGFR_R_phosphorylated"" and species_1 as ""EGFR_R_free"". But the guidelines also say to use the name column if possible. The name for species_0 is pEGFR, which is phosphorylated, so maybe keeping it as ""EGFR_phosphorylated"" is better. Similarly, species_1\'s name is ""free_EGFR"", so ""EGFR_free"" seems appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word. So I\'ll use underscores to join the parts.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term:\n- species_0: ""EGFR_phosphorylated""\n- species_25: ""EGF""\n- species_1: ""EGFR_free""\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines. Each term is a single word, uses the name where possible, and includes the state if necessary. I don\'t see any ambiguity that needs resolving beyond what\'s provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given is an equation: Rp + GS => Rp_GS. The replacement table has three entries. Let\'s look at each row:\n\n1. Role: reactants, id: Rp, name: empty, references: EGF; EGFR.\n2. Role: reactants, id: GS, name: empty, references: empty.\n3. Role: products, id: Rp_GS, name: empty, references: EGFR.\n\nHmm, so for Rp, the references are EGF and EGFR. Since Rp is a reactant and EGF is a ligand while EGFR is a receptor, I need to figure out which one to use. The name column is empty, so I\'ll have to rely on the references. But which one is it? EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. Since Rp is the id, maybe it stands for something like \'receptor\'? So perhaps Rp should be EGFR.\n\nFor GS, the references are empty. So I don\'t have any information to map this. Maybe GS stands for something else, but without references, I can\'t determine the biological term. So I\'ll keep it as GS.\n\nThe product is Rp_GS, and the reference is EGFR. So, since Rp is likely EGFR, the product would be EGFR_GS. But wait, what does GS stand for? Without info, I can\'t change it, so it remains GS.\n\nPutting it together, the JSON should map Rp to EGFR, GS stays as GS, and Rp_GS to EGFR_GS.\n\nI think that\'s it. I\'m making sure to follow the guidelines, using the references when available and keeping terms as-is when there\'s no additional info. Also, I\'m ensuring each term is a single word and combining receptor and ligand terms with underscores.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nThe input given includes an equation: Rp_RasGAP => Rp + RasGAP; mIRSp_SHP2. The replacement table has four entries, but two of them are in the \'reactants\' and \'modifiers\' roles. The \'id\'s are Rp_RasGAP, Rp, RasGAP, and mIRSp_SHP2.\n\nStarting with Rp_RasGAP: The role is reactants, and both name and references are empty. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s a complex or a protein. I need to see if Rp or RasGAP have references elsewhere. Looking at the products, Rp is associated with EGF and EGFR, so Rp might be the receptor part. RasGAP is a known protein, so perhaps it\'s a GAP for Ras. So Rp_RasGAP could be EGF Receptor bound to RasGAP, making it EGFR_bound_to_RasGAP. But the guidelines say to make it a single word, so I\'ll join them with underscores: EGFR_RasGAP.\n\nNext, Rp: It\'s a product with references EGF and EGFR. Since EGFR is the receptor, Rp is likely EGFR. So the term is EGFR.\n\nThen, RasGAP: It\'s a product with no references, but it\'s a known protein. So it remains RasGAP.\n\nLastly, mIRSp_SHP2: It\'s a modifier with no name or references. The id has \'SHP2\', which is a known phosphatase. \'mIRSp\' might be a modifier, but without more info, I\'ll assume it\'s SHP2. Alternatively, if \'mIRSp\' is a specific context, it could be something like SHP2_mIRSp, but since the guidelines suggest not changing if it\'s interpretable as-is, I\'ll just use SHP2.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. So Rp_RasGAP becomes EGFR_RasGAP, Rp becomes EGFR, RasGAP stays as RasGAP, and mIRSp_SHP2 becomes SHP2.\n\nI need to ensure each value is a single word, so combining where necessary. Also, since the references for Rp point to EGF and EGFR, it makes sense to map Rp to EGFR. For mIRSp_SHP2, without more context, it\'s safer to just use SHP2.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore.

The first row is for reactants with id \'Ra\', name \'EGF_EGFR\', and references \'EGFR; EGF\'. The second row is products with id \'R2\', name \'(EGF_EGFR)2\', and references \'EGF; EGFR\'.\n\nSo, I need to map each id (\'Ra\' and \'R2\') to a term. Starting with \'Ra\', the name is \'EGF_EGFR\', which is a combination of EGF (epidermal growth factor) and EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). Since it\'s a ligand-receptor pair, I should keep it as is, so \'EGF_EGFR\' is the term.\n\nNext, for \'R2\', the name is \'(EGF_EGFR)2\'. This suggests a dimer, so I need to represent that. The guideline says if a term is an abbreviation or clear, don\'t change it much. But here, it\'s a bit ambiguous. Since the name is a dimer, I can represent it as \'EGF_EGFR_dimer\' to make it biologically clear.\n\nI should check if there are any references or synonyms. Both \'Ra\' and \'R2\' refer to EGF and EGFR, so the terms are consistent. The names are already in a usable form, so I don\'t need to make major changes beyond adding \'dimer\' for \'R2\'.\n\nSo, compiling this, the JSON would have \'Ra\' mapped to \'EGF_EGFR\' and \'R2\' mapped to \'EGF_EGFR_dimer\'.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So I should combine them as ""EGF_EGFR"". The ""Inh"" might mean inhibited, but the guidelines say to use context. Maybe it\'s not needed here since it\'s already part of the name. So c499 becomes ""EGF_EGFR"".\n\nNext, c529. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP"". The references are empty, so I\'ll rely on the name. ""ErbB1"" is the same as EGFR, and ""h"" could stand for the homo dimer or perhaps the receptor in a certain state. Since it\'s bound to ATP, maybe it\'s an active state. So I can combine as ""EGFR_ATP"".\n\nNow, c551. The name is a complex: ""(EGF:ErbB1:Inh::EGF:ErbB1_h:ATP)"". The product is a combination of c499 and c529. Since they\'re both EGF and EGFR, the product would be a complex. So I\'ll combine them with an underscore: ""EGF_EGFR_complex"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word.

The guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation or interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much. But in this case, the names seem a bit complex with the ""i^2"" and ""i*^2"".\n\nWait, the term for x11 is ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". Maybe ""i"" stands for inactive, and the superscript 2 could indicate dimerization or something. Similarly, x8 is ""EGF-EGFRi*^2"", where ""*"" might indicate active. But I\'m not sure about the exact meaning of these symbols. Since the references for x8 are ""EGFR; EGF"", perhaps the active form is just ""EGFR_EGF"".\n\nBut the name for x11 is a bit confusing. It has ""EGF-EGFRi^2"". Maybe ""i^2"" is a way to denote a modified form. But without more context, I might have to make an educated guess. Alternatively, perhaps ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" is just a placeholder for an inactive form, but since the name is a bit unclear, I should look for a more interpretable term.\n\nHowever, the guidelines suggest that if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe I should just use the name as it is, but replace it with a more standard term. Since the references for x8 are EGFR and EGF, perhaps x8 represents the active form, so maybe ""EGFR_EGF_active"".\n\nWait, but the output in the example was {""x11"": ""EGF-EGFRi"", ""x8"": ""EGFR_EGF""}. So maybe the approach is to take the name and simplify it by removing the superscripts, keeping it as ""EGF-EGFRi"" for x11 and ""EGFR_EGF"" for x8.\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because the guidelines suggest connecting receptor and ligand with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So maybe x8 should be ""EGFR_EGF"" to indicate the receptor-ligand complex.\n\nAs for x11, ""EGF-EGFRi^2"" might be a way to denote an inactive form. So maybe ""EGF-EGFRi"" is acceptable, or perhaps ""EGFR_EGF_inactive"". But without more context, it\'s hard to say. The example output uses ""EGF-EGFRi"" for x11, so maybe that\'s the way to go.\n\nI should also consider the guidelines about states. If the term includes a state like ""active"" or ""bound,"" it should be part of the term with an underscore.

So, E1 should map to ErbB1. Since ErbB1 is a known receptor (EGFR is another name for it), maybe I should consider if it\'s a receptor or ligand. In this case, ErbB1 is a receptor, so perhaps it\'s EGF\'s receptor. But the name column says ErbB1, so I should stick to that unless the references suggest a different term. Since the name is specific, I don\'t need to change it.\n\nNext, the second row is for products: id is E_E1, name is EGF-ErbB1, references are EGFR and EGF. So, this is a complex of EGF and ErbB1.

I need to make this a single word. Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, perhaps I should combine them. Wait, the role here is reactants, but the term is a complex. Maybe I should represent it as EGF bound to ErbB1. So, I could write it as ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" to indicate the bound state.\n\nFor the product, E11, the name is ""(EGF-ErbB1)2"", which implies a dimer. So, it\'s two EGF-ErbB1 complexes. Since it\'s a dimer, I should represent it as ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"". This way, it\'s clear it\'s the same complex in a dimer form.\n\nWait, but the user mentioned that if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it much. But in this case, E_E1 is an id, so I need to map it to a term. The name is ""EGF-ErbB1"", which is a bit long, but since I need a single word, I can combine them with underscores and add the state if necessary.\n\nAnother thought: Since the references include EGFR and EGF, I should consider using the most common abbreviations. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, maybe ""EGF_EGFR"" would be more standard. But in the name, it\'s ""EGF-ErbB1"", and ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. So, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is better.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" for R, which is the receptor. So maybe I should treat E_E1 as a receptor-ligand complex. So, ""EGF"" is the ligand, ""ErbB1"" is the receptor. Therefore, the term could be ""EGF_ErbB1"" as a single word, but since they\'re bound, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"".\n\nBut looking at the product, it\'s (EGF-ErbB1)2, which is a dimer. So, perhaps the product should be ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map E_E1 to ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"" and E11 to ""EGF_ErbB1_dimer"".\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term is a single word, using underscores to combine receptor and ligand, and including states like bound or active. Since E_E1 is a reactant and forms a dimer in the product, using ""bound"" for the reactant makes sense, and ""dimer"" for the product.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""R"" maps to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to apply similar logic here. The input has an equation Rd => Rp and a replacement table with two rows.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For role \'reactants\', id \'Rd\' has no name but references \'EGF; EGFR\'.\n- For role \'products\', id \'Rp\' also has no name but the same references.\n\nSo, both Rd and Rp are mapped to the same references: EGF and EGFR. EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The task is to map each id to a biologically meaningful term.\n\nSince both have the same references, I need to figure out what each id represents. Rd is a reactant, which in biological terms, could be the unbound ligand. Rp is a product, which could be the bound form, like the ligand bound to the receptor.\n\nSo, for Rd, since it\'s the reactant, it\'s likely the ligand EGF. So, the term would be \'EGF\'. For Rp, as the product, it\'s the receptor-ligand complex. So, combining them, it would be \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. So, maybe for Rp, it\'s the receptor with the ligand bound. So, the term would be \'EGFR_bound\' or \'EGF_EGFR_bound\'? Hmm, but the example shows \'IL6_R\' for \'R\', which is the receptor. So perhaps for the product, which is the bound form, we should include both the receptor and the ligand, and the state.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the product is just the receptor in its active or bound state. Since the product is formed after the reaction, it\'s likely the bound form. So, combining the receptor with the state \'bound\' would make sense.\n\nSo, for Rd, since it\'s the reactant, it\'s EGF. For Rp, since it\'s the product, it\'s EGFR in the bound state with EGF. But the guidelines suggest using the name column if available, but here the name is empty. So, I need to rely on the references.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Rd is the receptor (EGFR) in the unbound state, and Rp is the receptor in the bound state with EGF. But the references for both are EGF and EGFR, so perhaps Rd is EGF (ligand) and Rp is the complex.\n\nWait, but in the equation Rd => Rp, it\'s a transformation. So, perhaps Rd is the receptor (EGFR) and Rp is the receptor-ligand complex. But since both have the same references, I\'m a bit confused.\n\nWait, looking back at the replacement table, both Rd and Rp have references EGF and EGFR. So, Rd is a reactant, which is likely the receptor (EGFR) before binding. Rp is the product, which is the receptor bound to EGF.\n\nSo, Rd would map to \'EGFR\' and Rp would map to \'EGFR_bound\' or \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'.\n\nBut the guidelines say to use the name column if possible, but it\'s empty here. So, I need to create terms based on the references.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rd is EGF (the ligand) and Rp is the bound complex. So, Rd would be \'EGF\' and Rp would be \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me think again. The equation is Rd => Rp. In biological terms, this could represent the binding of EGF to EGFR, forming the bound complex. So, Rd is EGF (the ligand) and Rp is the bound complex.\n\nSo, for Rd, the term would be \'EGF\'. For Rp, it\'s the receptor bound to EGF, so \'EGFR_bound\' or \'EGFR_EGF_bound\'. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine with an underscore. So, perhaps \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' is more accurate.\n\nWait, but the example used \'IL6_R\' for \'R\' and \'CSF1R_L\' for \'L\', which are single words. So, maybe \'EGFR_bound\' is sufficient, as it\'s a single word combining the receptor and the state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s better to include both the receptor and ligand in the term, but that would make it two words. Hmm, but the guidelines specify a single word. So, perhaps \'EGFR_bound\' is the way to go.\n\nWait, but the references for both are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps for Rd, it\'s the ligand EGF, and for Rp, it\'s the receptor in the bound state.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rd is the receptor before binding, and Rp is the receptor after binding. So, Rd would be \'EGFR\' and Rp would be \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe I should look for similar examples. In the given example, \'R\' maps to \'IL6_R\' and \'L\' maps to \'CSF1R_L\'. So, perhaps for Rd, which is a reactant, it\'s the ligand, and Rp is the receptor in the bound state.\n\nSo, Rd is EGF, so the term is \'EGF\'. Rp is the bound receptor, so \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rp is the complex, so \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' but that\'s three words. Wait, the guidelines say each term must be a single word, so perhaps \'EGFR_bound\' is better.\n\nWait, but in the example, \'R\' is \'IL6_R\' which is receptor, and \'L\' is \'CSF1R_L\' which is ligand. So, perhaps in this case, Rd is the ligand, and Rp is the receptor with the ligand bound.\n\nSo, Rd would be \'EGF\', and Rp would be \'EGFR_bound\'.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Rp is the receptor-ligand complex, so \'EGFR_EGF_bound\' but that\'s two parts, so maybe just \'EGFR_bound\' is acceptable.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""Rd"": ""EGF"",\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR_bound""\n}\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, both have references to EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps for Rd, it\'s the ligand EGF, and for Rp, it\'s the receptor EGFR in the bound state.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, I\'ll map Rd to \'EGF\' and Rp to \'EGFR_bound\'.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example equation: Rp + PI3K => Rp_PI3K. The replacement table has three rows. The first two are reactants, Rp and PI3K, and the product is Rp_PI3K.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, Rp\'s name is blank, but the references mention EGF and EGFR. So, Rp must be referring to the receptor. Since EGF is the ligand and EGFR is the receptor, Rp should map to EGFR. So, Rp becomes ""EGFR"".\n\nPI3K\'s name is empty, but it\'s a known enzyme in biology, so I\'ll keep it as ""PI3K"" since it\'s a standard abbreviation and doesn\'t need further interpretation.\n\nThe product is Rp_PI3K, which, after replacing Rp with EGFR, becomes ""EGFR_PI3K"". Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s a complex, so the underscore makes sense here.\n\nI need to make sure I don\'t add any extra information beyond the JSON. Each key is the \'id\', and the value is the term. So, the JSON should look like:\n\n{\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""PI3K"": ""PI3K"",\n  ""Rp_PI3K"": ""EGFR_PI3K""\n}\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check to make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to use the \'name\' column if possible, but since Rp\'s name is blank, I used the reference. PI3K is straightforward. The product combines both. Yep, that should do it.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given includes an equation: iSrc => aSrc; Rp, IRp. Then there\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. For iSrc, the role is reactants, id is iSrc, name is empty, references are empty. Since there\'s no name or reference, I need to think about what iSrc could stand for. It might be a typo or shorthand. Given the context, maybe \'i\' stands for inactive, so inactive Src. So, I\'ll map iSrc to \'Inactive_Src\'.\n\n2. aSrc is a product, so it\'s the active form of Src. The name and references are empty, but following the same logic, aSrc would be \'Active_Src\'.\n\n3. Rp has the role modifiers, id Rp, name empty, references are EGF and EGFR. EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor. So Rp should be \'EGFR\'.\n\n4. IRp is another modifier, id IRp, name empty, references are also EGF and EGFR. Since both Rp and IRp refer to the same receptors, but the name is empty, I might think IRp is the inactive form of the receptor. So, \'Inactive_EGFR\'.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it much. But in this case, Rp and IRp are abbreviations for receptors. Since the references point to EGF and EGFR, it makes sense to map Rp to \'EGFR\' and IRp to \'Inactive_EGFR\'.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""iSrc"": ""Inactive_Src"",\n  ""aSrc"": ""Active_Src"",\n  ""Rp"": ""EGFR"",\n  ""IRp"": ""Inactive_EGFR""\n}\n\nI think this makes sense. Each id is mapped to a single word or a combined term with states, following the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the input includes an equation: L_EGFR_dimer becomes L_dpEGFR. There\'s a replacement table with two entries. Both have the same references: EGF and EGFR, but different roles—reactants and products.\n\nThe guidelines say each term should be a single word. So, I can\'t have spaces. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"".\n\nLooking at the replacement table, the \'id\'s are L_EGFR_dimer and L_dpEGFR. The \'name\' column is empty, so I need to rely on the \'references\' which are EGF and EGFR.\n\nI remember that EGFR is the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor, and EGF is its ligand. So, in the context of reactions, L might stand for ligand. Therefore, L_EGFR_dimer could be EGF bound to EGFR, forming a dimer. Similarly, L_dpEGFR might be a processed form, maybe the soluble EGFR.\n\nWait, the references are the same for both, but the roles are reactants and products. So, the reactant is the dimer (EGFR bound to EGF), and the product is the processed EGFR, perhaps without the EGF.\n\nSo, for the reactant, it\'s the EGF bound to EGFR, forming a dimer. That would be EGF as the ligand, so the term should be EGF_EGFR. Since it\'s a dimer, maybe we can add \'bound\' or \'dimer\' as a state. But the guideline says to use states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term with an underscore. So, maybe EGF_EGFR_bound or EGF_EGFR_dimer.\n\nBut the \'name\' column is empty, so I need to rely on the \'references\'. Since both references are EGF and EGFR, I think the term should combine them. So, for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s the ligand (EGF) bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"". But since it\'s a dimer, perhaps ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nSimilarly, for L_dpEGFR, it\'s the processed form, so maybe just ""EGFR_s"" where \'s\' stands for soluble. Or maybe ""EGFR_soluble"".\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\'s are L_EGFR_dimer and L_dpEGFR. The \'name\' is empty, but the references are EGF and EGFR. So, I think the correct terms are EGF (ligand) and EGFR (receptor). But how to represent them?\n\nThe equation shows that L_EGFR_dimer is converted to L_dpEGFR. So, the reactant is the dimer (probably EGF bound to EGFR), and the product is the processed EGFR without the ligand.\n\nSo, for L_EGFR_dimer, the term should be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" or ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"". The product, L_dpEGFR, might be ""EGFR_s"" or ""EGFR_soluble"".\n\nBut the guidelines say to use single words, so maybe ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" is better than adding ""dimer"". Or perhaps ""EGFR_dimer"".\n\nWait, but the \'id\' is L_EGFR_dimer. Since L is ligand, it\'s EGF, so L_EGFR_dimer would be EGF bound to EGFR in a dimer. So, combining ligand and receptor, it\'s EGF_EGFR. Since it\'s a dimer, maybe ""EGF_EGFR_dimer"".\n\nFor L_dpEGFR, dp usually stands for dimerization or processing. So, it\'s the processed form of EGFR. Maybe ""EGFR_processed"" or ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut I need to make sure it\'s a single word. So, ""EGFR_s"" or ""EGFR_soluble"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map:\n\n{\n  ""L_EGFR_dimer"": ""EGF_EGFR_bound"",\n  ""L_dpEGFR"": ""EGFR_soluble""\n}\n\nWait, but the user provided an output example where they used ""EGF_EGFR"" for both. Hmm. Maybe I should reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, since both have the same references, maybe the terms are simply ""EGF"" and ""EGFR"". But the guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore if they can be identified. So, L is ligand (EGF), EGFR is receptor. So, for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s EGF bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR_bound"".\n\nAnd L_dpEGFR is the processed EGFR, so maybe ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut the \'id\'s are L_EGFR_dimer and L_dpEGFR, so perhaps the terms are ""EGF_EGFR"" and ""EGFR"".\n\nWait, maybe I\'m overcomplicating. The replacement table has \'id\'s with L and EGFR. The references are EGF and EGFR. So, L_EGFR_dimer is EGF bound to EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"". L_dpEGFR is the soluble EGFR, so ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut the user\'s output example had ""EGF_EGFR"" for both. Maybe that\'s the case here too.\n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""L_EGFR_dimer"": ""EGF_EGFR"",\n  ""L_dpEGFR"": ""EGF_EGFR""\n}\n\nBut that seems off because the product is a different state. Alternatively, perhaps the product is just ""EGFR"".\n\nBut the guidelines say to use the \'name\' column if available. Since the \'name\' is empty, use the references. So, for L_EGFR_dimer, it\'s EGF and EGFR, so ""EGF_EGFR"". For L_dpEGFR, it\'s EGFR, so ""EGFR"".\n\nWait, but the product is the result after the dimer is processed, so maybe it\'s ""EGFR_soluble"" or ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut the user\'s example output used ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, so maybe that\'s acceptable.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, as per the references, even though the product is a different state. Alternatively, perhaps the product should be ""EGFR_s"".\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. I\'ll proceed with ""EGF_EGFR"" for both, as the references are the same.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` refers to a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and add them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. For each `id`, I should first map it to its `name` and then use the references to refine it if necessary. If the `name` is already clear, I might not need to change it. But if the `name` is an abbreviation or ambiguous, I should use the references to find a better term.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is c143 + c499 => c494.\n\nThe replacement table has:\n- c143: ErbB4\n- c499: EGF:ErbB1:Inh with references EGF; EGFR\n- c494: EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4 with references EGF; EGFR\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s go one by one.\n\nStarting with c143: The name is ErbB4, and the references don\'t provide additional info. Since ErbB4 is a known receptor tyrosine kinase, I can use it as is. So c143 maps to ""ErbB4"".\n\nNext, c499: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF; EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. The term ""Inh"" might refer to an inhibitor or maybe something else. But in this context, EGF binds to EGFR (ErbB1). So the term EGF:ErbB1:Inh could be interpreted as EGF bound to EGFR, perhaps in an inhibited state. So, to make it a single word, I can combine them as ""EGF_ErbB1"". The ""Inh"" part might indicate a state, so maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_active"" or ""EGF_ErbB1_bound"". But the example didn\'t include states, so perhaps just ""EGF_ErbB1"" is sufficient.\n\nThen, c494: The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB4, with references EGF; EGFR. So this seems like a complex involving EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4. Since c143 is ErbB4 and c499 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, perhaps c494 is the product of their interaction. So, combining EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB4, it would be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4"".\n\nWait, but the references for c499 and c494 are the same, both EGF and EGFR. So maybe c499 is the EGF bound to EGFR (ErbB1), and c494 is that complex interacting with ErbB4. So, the product term should reflect that combination.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map:\n- c143: ""ErbB4""\n- c499: ""EGF_ErbB1""\n- c494: ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB4""\n\nI think that\'s accurate based on the guidelines. Each term is a single word, using the names from the table, combining receptor and ligand where appropriate. I don\'t see a need for states here since the example didn\'t include them, and the references didn\'t specify any. So this should be the correct mapping.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c10 + c154 => c160. So, c10 and c154 are reactants, and c160 is the product.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each id has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references. My task is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines.\n\nLet\'s take each id one by one.\n\nStarting with c10. The name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. Hmm, EGF is epidermal growth factor, ErbB1 is a receptor, and ATP is adenosine triphosphate. The guidelines say to use context and references. Since EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is a receptor, I should combine them with an underscore. So maybe EGF_ErbB1. But wait, the references also mention EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So perhaps EGF_EGFR makes sense, but since the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, maybe I should include ATP? But the guidelines say each term should be a single word. So combining EGF and ErbB1 gives EGF_ErbB1.\n\nNext, c154. The name is ErbB3, and there are no references. Since it\'s a single word and already a receptor name, I can keep it as ErbB3.\n\nNow, c160. The name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3), and references are EGF and EGFR. So it\'s a complex of EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB3. According to the guidelines, I can combine ligand and receptor with an underscore. Since EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the primary receptor, and ErbB3 is a co-receptor. So the complex might be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3. But I need to make sure it\'s a single word, so underscores are okay.\n\nWait, the guidelines also mention considering states like bound or active. In this case, the product is a complex, which implies a bound state. So maybe I should append _bound to the term. So EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term:\n\n{\n  ""c10"": ""EGF_ErbB1"",\n  ""c154"": ""ErbB3"",\n  ""c160"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_bound""\n}\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines. I combined ligand and receptor with underscores, considered the state as bound, and used the names from the replacement table prioritizing consistency.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, it seems like if the term is a receptor (R) or ligand (L), I need to combine them with an underscore. Also, sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using the references.\n\nThe output should be a JSON object with `id` as the key and the term as the value. No explanations, just the JSON.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided. The equation is c499 + c499 => c501. The replacement table has three rows, all with the same `id` c499 and c501, but different roles and references.\n\nWait, no, actually, the replacement table shows c499 as a reactant with the name ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"". Similarly, c501 is a product with the name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"" and references ""EGF; EGFR"".\n\nSo, the task is to map each `id` (c499 and c501) to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with c499.\n\nThe name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"". The references are ""EGF; EGFR"". I know that EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor for EGF, also known as EGFR. The ""Inh"" part is a bit confusing. Maybe it\'s a state like ""inhibited"" or ""bound""? Or perhaps it\'s a typo and should be ""act"" for active? The references don\'t mention ""Inh"", so maybe it\'s a state.\n\nSo, I need to map c499 to a single word. The name has EGF, ErbB1, and Inh. Since the role is reactant, and the product is 2 times the same, perhaps it\'s a dimerization. But in the example given, they used ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" for c499, and ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound"" for c501. Hmm, but that\'s two words. Wait, no, the example in the guidelines used an underscore to combine them into a single term.\n\nWait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So, perhaps I should combine the ligand and receptor with an underscore, and then add a state if necessary.\n\nIn the input, the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor. The ""Inh"" might indicate an inhibited state or perhaps ""bound"". Alternatively, it could be ""active"". But since the references don\'t specify, I need to make an educated guess.\n\nIn biology, when a ligand binds to a receptor, it often changes the state of the receptor, sometimes leading to activation. So, maybe ""Inh"" stands for ""inhibited"" or ""bound"". Alternatively, perhaps it\'s a typo and should be ""act"" for active.\n\nBut since the name is given as ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"", I think it\'s safer to use ""bound"" as the state because ligand binding typically induces a conformational change, which can be considered a bound state.\n\nSo, for c499, the term would be ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" because EGF binds to EGFR (ErbB1). But wait, in the replacement table, the references are EGF and EGFR, so perhaps the name should be based on that. The name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"", but the references are EGF and EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So, I think it\'s better to use the receptor name from the references, which is EGFR.\n\nSo, c499 would be ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" because EGF is the ligand binding to EGFR, and the ""Inh"" suggests a bound state.\n\nFor c501, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:Inh)"". This likely means two units of the complex. So, perhaps it\'s the dimerization of the receptor-ligand complex. In biology, when receptors bind ligands, they often form dimers, which is a common mechanism for signal transduction.\n\nSo, c501 would be the dimer of c499, which is ""EGFR_EGF_bound"". To indicate dimerization, perhaps we can add another ""_bound"" to indicate the state, making it ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound"". Alternatively, maybe just using a subscript 2, but the guidelines say each term must be a single word, so underscores are the way to go.\n\nWait, but the example in the guidelines showed ""IL6_R_active"" as a single term. So, for the dimer, perhaps it\'s better to represent it as a single term with two ""bound"" states, hence ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe the dimerization is represented by the product being two of the same complex, so the term would just be the same as c499 but multiplied, but since it\'s a single term, we can\'t do that. So, perhaps we just append ""_bound"" again to indicate the dimer state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would map c499 to ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" and c501 to ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound"".\n\nWait, but in the example provided in the guidelines, the user had c499 as ""EGFR_EGF_bound"" and c501 as ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound"". So, that\'s consistent with what I came up with.\n\nI think that makes sense. So, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c499"": ""EGFR_EGF_bound"",\n  ""c501"": ""EGFR_EGF_bound_bound""\n}\n\nI think that follows all the guidelines: each term is a single word with underscores, uses the receptor and ligand names from the references, and includes the state where applicable.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is c530 + c16 => c10. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. Each id has a name and references which might be useful.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- c530 is a reactant, name is ""ErbB1_h:ATP"". Hmm, the name seems to combine two terms with a colon. The guidelines mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we can combine them with an underscore. So maybe ""ErbB1_ATP""?\n\n- c16 is EGF, and the references also point to EGF. Since it\'s a single term and straightforward, it stays as ""EGF"".\n\n- c10 is a product, name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"", and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. The name combines three terms. According to the guidelines, if it\'s a complex, we can join them with underscores. So it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"".\n\nWait, but in the example, they used ""IL6_R_active"". So if c10 is a complex, maybe it\'s ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"" as a single term.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so colons in the name should be converted to underscores. Also, if there are states like active or bound, they should be added as underscores, but in this case, there\'s no indication of that.\n\nSo the mapping would be:\n\nc530 → ""ErbB1_ATP""\n\nc16 → ""EGF""\n\nc10 → ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP""\n\nI think that\'s correct. Let me double-check the guidelines. Each term must be a single word, so replacing colons with underscores makes sense. The name column for c10 has all three components, so combining them into one term with underscores is appropriate. Since there\'s no state mentioned, I don\'t add anything else.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has three entries with IDs c149, c105, and c127. Each has a role (reactants or products), a name, and references. The goal is to map each id to a single word that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the first row, c149 is a reactant with the name (ErbB1:ErbB3)_P. The references are empty, so I need to rely on the name. ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors, so I think they form a heterodimer here. The ""_P"" might indicate phosphorylation, so I should combine them with an underscore and add ""_active"" or something. Maybe ""ErbB1_ErbB3_active"" makes sense because it\'s a bound state.\n\nNext, c105 is ATP with a concentration of 1.2e9. The name is straightforward, so I don\'t need to change it. It\'s a ligand, so maybe ""ATP_L"" would be appropriate, indicating it\'s a ligand.\n\nThen, c127 is a product with the name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3:ATP and references EGF and EGFR. Since EGF is the ligand binding to the receptors ErbB1 and ErbB3, and ATP is involved, the product term should reflect the active state. So combining EGF, ErbB1, ErbB3, and ATP as a complex, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_ATP_bound"" would work, indicating the bound state of the complex.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so using underscores is the way to go. Also, considering states like ""active"" or ""bound"" helps in making the terms more interpretable. I should avoid making unnecessary changes if the term is already clear, but in this case, creating combinations makes it more accurate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its respective term as I thought. I think that\'s the best approach based on the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""bEGFR"" maps to ""null"". The replacement table has ""bEGFR"" in the reactants with the name ""boundEGFR"" and references ""EGFR; EGF"". The products have ""null"" for both name and references.\n\nHmm, so the input equation is bEGFR => null. I need to map \'bEGFR\' to a biologically interpretable term. The replacement table says the name for \'bEGFR\' is \'boundEGFR\'. The references are \'EGFR\' and \'EGF\'. \n\nSince the name is \'boundEGFR\', that suggests it\'s the bound form of the EGF Receptor. In biology, EGFR is a receptor, and when it\'s bound, it\'s often referred to as being active or bound by its ligand, which is EGF. So the term should reflect that it\'s the receptor in a bound state.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, I should create a single word by combining the receptor name with the state. So ""boundEGFR"" can be ""EGFR_bound"" or ""EGFR_bound"" since it\'s a single word. Alternatively, since the name is ""boundEGFR"", maybe it\'s more accurate to keep it as ""boundEGFR"" because it\'s already a single word and biologically interpretable.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if the term is already interpretable, don\'t change it. So ""boundEGFR"" is a single word and makes sense biologically, so I shouldn\'t change it. The references are ""EGFR; EGF"", which are the receptor and ligand, but since the name is ""boundEGFR"", it\'s probably better to stick with that.\n\nFor the \'null\' id, the name is \'null\' and references are empty. So in the JSON, it should map to \'null\' as well. So the JSON would be {""bEGFR"": ""boundEGFR"", ""null"": ""null""}.\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach. I\'m not sure if I should consider the state as an underscore or if ""boundEGFR"" is sufficient. Since the name is already ""boundEGFR"", I don\'t need to make any changes. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s interpretable, so that\'s the way to go.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: fEGFR + EGF => bEGFR. The replacement table has three entries: fEGFR as freeEGFR, EGF as EGF, and bEGFR as boundEGFR. The references for fEGFR and bEGFR both point to EGFR, while EGF\'s reference is EGF.\n\nStarting with fEGFR. The name is freeEGFR, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should consider using the underscore notation. So, freeEGFR could be interpreted as EGFR in its free (unbound) state. Therefore, I\'ll map fEGFR to ""EGFR"".\n\nNext is EGF. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. Since it\'s a ligand, I should consider combining it with the receptor. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t change it. So EGF remains ""EGF"".\n\nLastly, bEGFR. The name is boundEGFR, and the reference is EGFR; EGF. This indicates that the bound state is when EGF binds to EGFR. So, the bound state could be represented as EGFR bound to EGF. Following the guidelines, since it\'s a specific state, I\'ll combine the receptor and ligand with an underscore and add the state. Thus, bEGFR becomes ""EGFR_EGF_bound"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should map each id to its term. I need to ensure each value is a single word, correctly formatted with underscores for receptor-ligand combinations and states.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"", it could become ""IL6_R"" or something similar. But I need to check if the receptor or ligand names are in the ""name"" column. If not, I should use context or references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then refine it using the references for accuracy. So I can\'t just stop at the `name`; I have to look into the references as well.\n\nAnother point is about states like ""bound"" or ""active."" If applicable, I should include those as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active."" But if the term is already clear as an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nThey also want me to prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column for consistency, even if the references have synonyms. So I should check both but give preference to the `name`.\n\nLooking at the input provided, the equation is bEGFR + PI3K => bEGFR + pPI3K. The replacement table has four rows with `id`, `name`, and `references`. Let me go through each `id` one by one.\n\nStarting with `bEGFR` in the reactants: the `name` is boundEGFR, and the references mention EGF and EGFR. So boundEGFR is already a descriptive name. It\'s an abbreviation, but since it\'s interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So the term for `bEGFR` would stay as ""boundEGFR.""\n\nNext is `PI3K` in reactants. The `name` is PI3K, and the references have a Miriam ID, but it\'s the same as another entry. Since PI3K is a well-known abbreviation for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, and it\'s interpretable as-is, I can keep it as ""PI3K.""\n\nMoving to the products, we have another `bEGFR`, which is the same as the reactant. So it\'s also ""boundEGFR.""\n\nLastly, `pPI3K` in products. The `name` is pPI3K, which likely stands for phosphorylated PI3K. The references include a Miriam ID for abao:0002007 and omit:0027264. Since pPI3K is an abbreviation that\'s reasonably clear, I don\'t need to change it. So it remains ""pPI3K.""\n\nI should make sure each `id` maps correctly without adding any extra words unless necessary. Since all the terms are already single words and don\'t require combining receptors or ligands, I can directly map them. Also, there\'s no need for states like ""active"" because the terms already indicate their state through the `name`.\n\nSo the final JSON should have each `id` as a key with its corresponding term. I\'ll structure it accordingly without any explanations, just the JSON object as requested.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

But according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is unless necessary. However, since the name is freeEGFR, it\'s more precise to use the full term. But wait, the guideline says if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s better not to change it. So maybe fEGFR should just be ""EGFR"" because the name is freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. Hmm, perhaps ""EGFR_free"" or ""EGFR"" itself. But the replacement table\'s name is freeEGFR, which might suggest it\'s the free form, but in the guidelines, if the term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it. So I\'m a bit confused here.\n\nWait, the replacement table\'s \'id\' is fEGFR, and the \'name\' is freeEGFR. The reference is EGFR. So maybe I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is just a state. But according to the guidelines, if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t make changes. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, but perhaps it\'s better to use the full term. But the guidelines say not to make significant changes if the term is an abbreviation or is interpretable. So maybe fEGFR is an abbreviation for freeEGFR, which is a state of EGFR. So perhaps the correct term is ""EGFR"".\n\nThen EGF. The \'id\' is EGF, the \'name\' is EGF, and the reference is EGF.

The guidelines say to prioritize the \'name\' column, so for fEGFR, the name is freeEGFR, but the reference is EGFR. So perhaps I should map fEGFR to ""EGFR"" because that\'s the receptor, and the \'name\' is a state. Similarly, bEGFR is boundEGFR, so ""EGFR_bound"". EGF is straightforward as it\'s the ligand.\n\nYes, that makes sense.

Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. Sometimes, I might need to go through a two-step process: first map id to name, then refine using references.\n\nLooking at the first row: role is reactants, id is c3, name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, and references are EGF; ATP; EGFR. So, I need to break down EGF:ErbB1:ATP. EGF is a ligand, ErbB1 is a receptor. So, maybe EGF_L and ErbB1_R. But wait, the name has three parts: EGF, ErbB1, and ATP. Hmm, ATP is a molecule, but maybe it\'s part of the receptor\'s active state. So, perhaps ErbB1 is the receptor, and since it\'s bound with ATP, maybe it\'s in an active state. So, I can combine them as ErbB1_R_active.\n\nNext, c140: role reactants, id c140, name ErbB3, no references. Since it\'s just ErbB3, which is a receptor, I can write it as ErbB3_R.\n\nThen, c146: role products, name EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, references EGF; EGFR. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors. So, EGF_L and the receptors as ErbB1_R and ErbB3_R. But in the products, they are combined. Wait, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3. So, maybe it\'s EGF bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB3 receptors. So, perhaps EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R, but that\'s more than one word. Wait, the guideline says each term must be a single word. Hmm, but this might be a complex, so maybe I can combine them as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3 or something similar. Alternatively, maybe the product is the active form of the receptors bound to EGF, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nWait, but the product id is c146, so I need to map it to a single term. Maybe I can think of it as a ternary complex. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, so perhaps I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3, but that\'s still multiple words. Alternatively, maybe it\'s an active state, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect with an underscore. So, maybe EGF is the ligand, so EGF_L, and ErbB1 and ErbB3 are receptors, so ErbB1_R and ErbB3_R. But in the products, they are all together, so perhaps the term is EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R. But that\'s four words. Wait, but each term in the JSON should be a single word. So, maybe I need to combine them into a single term, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3 or EGF_ErbB1R_ErbB3R.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptors after binding EGF, so maybe EGF_bound_ErbB1R_ErbB3R_active. But that\'s multiple words. Hmm, this is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the references. For c3, the references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. So, EGFR is another name for ErbB1. So, perhaps EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is part of the active state. So, c3 could be EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active, which is a single term with underscores.\n\nFor c140, it\'s ErbB3, so just ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, and references include EGF and EGFR. So, EGFR is ErbB1. So, c146 is the product of EGF binding to ErbB1 and ErbB3. So, perhaps EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R. But again, that\'s four words. Wait, maybe I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_R, but that\'s still multiple words. Alternatively, perhaps it\'s an active complex, so EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nBut I\'m supposed to make each term a single word. So, maybe I need to combine them into a single string with underscores, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. So, perhaps for c3, since it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ATP, which implies the ligand EGF is bound to the receptor ErbB1 with ATP, which might indicate the active state. So, I can write it as EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active.\n\nFor c140, it\'s just ErbB3, so ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146, it\'s EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3, so perhaps the active form where EGF is bound to both ErbB1 and ErbB3, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.

Alternatively, perhaps I should use the references to see if there\'s a more specific term. The references for c146 include EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1. So, maybe the product is the active form of ErbB1 and ErbB3 bound to EGF, so EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure if that\'s the correct way to represent it as a single term. Maybe it\'s better to represent it as a complex, like EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to consider states like bound or active. So, perhaps c146 is the active form, so I can write it as EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely confident. Maybe I should go step by step.\n\nFor c3: EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, and ATP is part of the active state. So, EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active.\n\nFor c140: ErbB3, so ErbB3_R.\n\nFor c146: EGF:ErbB1:ErbB3. So, it\'s the combination of EGF with both ErbB1 and ErbB3. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form where EGF is bound to both receptors. So, EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active.\n\nBut that\'s a long term, but it\'s a single word with underscores. Alternatively, maybe it\'s EGF_ErbB1_ErbB3_active.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So, the JSON would map c3 to ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active"", c140 to ""ErbB3_R"", and c146 to ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if a term is a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. So, maybe I should check if EGF is an abbreviation. EGF stands for Epidermal Growth Factor, which is a ligand, so it\'s better to write it as EGF_L.\n\nSimilarly, ErbB1 is a receptor, so ErbB1_R.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_active"",\n  ""c140"": ""ErbB3_R"",\n  ""c146"": ""EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ErbB3_R_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best I can do based on the guidelines.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Let\'s start with c1. The name is EGF, and the reference is EGF. EGF is a well-known ligand, so I can keep it as is since it\'s a single word and already interpretable.\n\nNext is c286. The name is ErbB1:Inh, and the reference is EGFR. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, which is the epidermal growth factor receptor. The "":Inh"" part might stand for inhibitor, but I\'m not sure. However, the guidelines say if a term can be identified as a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. Since EGFR is a receptor, I should represent it as something like ""EGFR_R"". The "":Inh"" might indicate an inhibited state, so maybe ""EGFR_R_inactive"" or ""EGFR_R_bound"". But the references say EGFR, so maybe I can just use ""EGFR_R"".\n\nNow, c499. The name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like a complex, maybe the ligand-receptor complex. Since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 (EGFR) is the receptor, the complex would be EGF bound to EGFR. The "":Inh"" part might indicate that the receptor is in an inhibited state. So, combining them with an underscore and adding the state, it could be ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map c1 to ""EGF"", c286 to ""EGFR_R"", and c499 to ""EGF_EGFR_R_inactive"". I should double-check to ensure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. For c286, I considered if it should include \'inactive\' but since the name is ErbB1:Inh, it\'s better to include the state. However, the references just say EGFR, so maybe \'EGFR_R\' is sufficient. For c499, combining the ligand and receptor with the state makes sense.\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines and the provided data.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nThe input given is an equation: c11 => c86. The replacement table has two rows. For c11, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references include EGF, ATP, and EGFR. For c86, the name is ""R_degraded"" with no references.\n\nStarting with c11. The name is a bit complex: ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and ErbB1 is the receptor, also known as EGFR. ATP is Adenosine Triphosphate. The term is a trimer, so it\'s EGF bound to ErbB1 with ATP. Since it\'s a ligand-receptor complex, I should combine them with an underscore. EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 is the receptor, so it becomes ""EGF_ErbB1"". The \'2\' might indicate dimerization, but the guidelines say to keep it a single word, so I\'ll omit the number. So, c11 maps to ""EGF_ErbB1"".\n\nNext, c86. The name is ""R_degraded"". From the references of c11, R likely stands for receptor, which is ErbB1 or EGFR. So, ""R_degraded"" should be more specific. Since the receptor is EGFR, I\'ll use ""EGFR_degraded"". The guidelines mention using context, and here, the context is from c11\'s references. So c86 becomes ""EGFR_degraded"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, and states like \'degraded\' are included with an underscore. Also, I\'m prioritizing the name column but using references to clarify when needed. Since c86\'s name is ""R_degraded"" and the reference isn\'t provided, but from c11, R is EGFR, so it\'s logical to map it that way.\n\nI think that\'s all. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input equation is c4 + c105 => c116. There\'s a replacement table with three entries. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say I need to make sure each term is a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", include that with an underscore.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- c4 is a reactant with name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"" and references EGF, ATP, EGFR.\n- c105 is a reactant with name ""ATP 1.2e9"" and no references.\n- c116 is a product with name ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive"" and references EGF, EGFR.\n\nSo for c4, the name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"". I think this refers to a complex of EGF, ErbB1 (which is the EGFR), and ATP. Since it\'s a complex, maybe it\'s the receptor-ligand-ATP trimer? So perhaps it\'s ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"". But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)"", but I need to make it a single word. Maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"".\n\nFor c105, the name is ""ATP 1.2e9"". Since the guidelines say if it\'s a simple term, leave it as is. So ""ATP"".\n\nc116\'s name is ""2(EGF:ErbB1:ATP)-FullActive"". It\'s a product, so it\'s the active form. So maybe ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"".\n\nWait, but in the example, the product in the output was ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active"". So I think that\'s correct.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""c4"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c116"": ""EGFR_EGF_ATP_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s how it should be mapped based on the guidelines and the given replacement table.', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c162 + c105 => c123. Each of these ids (c162, c105, c123) is listed in the replacement table with their names and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c162, the name is (ErbB1:ErbB2)_P. The references are empty. Since ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors, and there's a '_P' which might stand for phosphorylated, but according to the guidelines, I should connect receptor and ligand with an underscore. However, since both are receptors, maybe it's a dimer. So, I'll consider it as a complex. So, the term would be ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP 1.2e9. The references are also empty. ATP is a ligand, so I can directly use 'ATP' as it's already a known term. The number might be a concentration, but since the guidelines say if it's interpretable as-is, we don't change it. So, c105 maps to 'ATP'.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor, which is ErbB1. So the complex here includes EGF binding to ErbB1 and ErbB2. So, the term would be EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2. The ATP is part of the complex, but since the guidelines say to include states or specific ligands, maybe we should include ATP as well? Wait, but the product is the complex with ATP, so perhaps it's the active form. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe it's part of the term. However, the references for c123 are EGF and EGFR, so perhaps we should focus on the main components. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' is sufficient, or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP' but that seems too long. Since the product is the complex after binding ATP, perhaps we can consider the state as 'bound' or 'active'. But the guidelines say to include states like 'bound' or 'active' as part of the term with an underscore. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe it's just part of the complex, so the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But I need to check the guidelines again.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So for c162, it's a complex of two receptors, so maybe it's 'ErbB1_ErbB2'. For c123, it's a complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and ATP. But the references are EGF and EGFR (which is ErbB1). So perhaps the main components are EGF and ErbB1, but since ErbB2 is also present, we include it. So, the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'. The ATP might be part of the process but perhaps not part of the main term. Alternatively, since the name includes ATP, maybe we should include it. But the references don't mention ATP, so maybe it's not necessary. Alternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of the receptor complex after binding ATP. So, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the product is the complex including ATP, perhaps the term is 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But that might be too long. Alternatively, maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' because it's bound to ATP. Hmm.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, it says to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. For c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP, and references are EGF and EGFR. So, perhaps the main components are EGF and EGFR (ErbB1), but since ErbB2 is also part of the complex, we include it. So the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'. The ATP is part of the product, but perhaps it's the state, so maybe 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active'. Alternatively, since ATP is a ligand, perhaps it's part of the complex, so 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But I'm not sure if that's the best approach.\n\nWait, the guidelines also say that if the term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable as-is, it's not recommended to make significant changes. So for c105, 'ATP' is already fine. For c162, (ErbB1:ErbB2)_P could be 'ErbB1_ErbB2_P' but the guidelines say to connect receptor and ligand with an underscore. But since both are receptors, perhaps it's just 'ErbB1_ErbB2'. The '_P' might indicate phosphorylation, but the guidelines don't mention states in that context. So maybe it's better to leave it as 'ErbB1_ErbB2'.\n\nFor c123, the name is (EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2):ATP. The references are EGF and EGFR. So EGF is the ligand, and EGFR is the receptor (ErbB1). So the complex is EGF bound to ErbB1 and ErbB2. So the term would be 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'. The ATP is part of the product, but perhaps it's the result of the reaction, so maybe the term doesn't include ATP. Alternatively, since the product includes ATP, perhaps it's part of the term, making it 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But I'm not sure if that's necessary. Alternatively, maybe the state is 'bound', so 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound'.\n\nWait, looking at the equation, c162 is a reactant, which is the ErbB1:ErbB2 dimer. c105 is ATP. The product is c123, which is the complex of EGF, ErbB1, ErbB2, and ATP. So perhaps the term should reflect the active state after binding ATP, so 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_active' or 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_bound'. But I'm not certain.\n\nAlternatively, since the name for c123 includes ATP, maybe the term should include it. So 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP'. But that might be too long. Alternatively, since the references only mention EGF and EGFR, perhaps the term is 'EGF_EGFR', but since ErbB2 is also part of the complex, it should be included. So, perhaps 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2'.\n\nI think I'll go with 'ErbB1_ErbB2' for c162, 'ATP' for c105, and 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2' for c123. The ATP in c123's name might be part of the reaction but not necessarily part of the term unless it's a state. Since the guidelines don't specify including all components, maybe just the main ligand and receptors are enough."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, the replacement table has columns: role, id, name, references. The roles are reactants, products, and modifiers. Each id has a name and sometimes references. My task is to map each id to a single word term that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nLet\'s go through each id one by one.\n\n1. **E**: The role is reactant, name is EGF, references are EGF. So, E should map to EGF. That\'s straightforward since it\'s already a single word and the name matches.\n\n2. **Empty**: The role is product, name is Empty, references are none. Since it\'s a product and the name is ""Empty"", I think it should stay as ""Empty"" because it\'s a state, not a specific molecule. The guidelines say if it\'s interpretable as-is, we don\'t change it.\n\n3. **E1**: Role is modifier, name is ErbB1, references EGFR. Now, ErbB1 is another name for EGFR, which is a receptor. So, since it\'s a receptor, I should denote it as such. The guidelines say to use an underscore if it\'s a receptor or ligand. So, ErbB1 is the receptor, so it becomes ""EGFR_R"". The name is ErbB1, but the reference is EGFR, so I\'ll go with the reference since it\'s more commonly known.\n\n4. **E_E1**: Role is modifier, name is EGF-ErbB1, references EGFR and EGF. Here, EGF is a ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor. So, the ligand is EGF and the receptor is EGFR. So, combining them with an underscore as ligand_receptor, it would be ""EGF_EGFR"". That makes sense because EGF binds to EGFR.\n\n5. **E1_PT**: Role is modifier, name is E1_p-PTP-1B, references are none. E1 is ErbB1 (EGFR), and p-PTP-1B is a protein tyrosine phosphatase. Since E1_PT involves a modification (phosphorylation by PTP-1B), I think it\'s about the receptor in a phosphorylated state. So, the term would be ""EGFR_R_bound"" because it\'s the receptor in a bound state, perhaps with the phosphatase.\n\n6. **E_E1_PT**: Role is modifier, name is E_E1_p-PTP-1B, references none. This seems to combine the ligand and the receptor in a modified state. So, it\'s EGF (ligand) bound to EGFR (receptor) which is phosphorylated. So, the term would be ""EGF_EGFR_bound"" indicating the complex is in a bound state.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, using underscores where necessary. For example, combining ligand and receptor, or adding states like bound or active.\n\nLet me double-check each mapping:\n\n- E → EGF (correct)\n- Empty → Empty (correct)\n- E1 → EGFR_R (since it\'s the receptor)\n- E_E1 → EGF_EGFR (ligand-receptor pair)\n- E1_PT → EGFR_R_bound (receptor in bound state)\n- E_E1_PT → EGF_EGFR_bound (complex in bound state)\n\nThis seems to align with the guidelines, especially the part about using the name column but sometimes the reference if it\'s more interpretable. Also, ensuring that states like bound are included with underscores.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

So, I need to map each id (Rp_pShc_GS, Rp, pShc_GS) to their respective terms.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- Rp_pShc_GS has no name or reference, so I might need to infer based on the other entries.\n- Rp is listed under products with references to EGF and EGFR. Since EGF is a ligand and EGFR is its receptor, I can map Rp to ""EGFR_R"".\n- pShc_GS also has no name or reference. The term \'pShc\' might refer to a phosphorylated adaptor protein, perhaps Shc. \'GS\' is unclear, but maybe it\'s a state like \'GTPase\' or \'state\'. Without more info, I\'ll consider it as part of the term, so ""Shc_pShc_GS"".\n\nPutting it all together, I create the JSON with these mappings.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Then there\'s a replacement table with three rows. The \'id\'s are Rp, Shc, and Rp_Shc. The \'name\' column for Rp is empty, but the references say EGF and EGFR. Shc\'s name and references are empty, but the product Rp_Shc has a reference to EGFR.\n\nSo, starting with Rp. The \'id\' is Rp, the \'name\' is empty, but the reference is EGF and EGFR. I need to map Rp to a single word. Since EGF is a ligand and EGFR is the receptor, Rp likely stands for the receptor. So, Rp should be mapped to EGFR.\n\nNext, Shc. The \'id\' is Shc, and both \'name\' and references are empty. Shc is a known adaptor protein in signaling pathways, often associated with receptors like EGFR. Since there\'s no reference, I\'ll use Shc as-is, but maybe it can be more specific. However, since the guidelines say if it\'s reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it. So Shc remains Shc.\n\nThen, Rp_Shc. The product\'s \'id\' is Rp_Shc, and the reference is EGFR. So, since Rp is EGFR, and Shc is the adaptor, Rp_Shc would be the complex of EGFR and Shc. Therefore, it should be EGFR_Shc.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if it\'s a two-step process, first map the \'id\' to \'name\' using the table, then refine using references. For Rp, since the \'name\' is empty, I have to rely on the references, which are EGF and EGFR. So Rp is the receptor, which is EGFR. So Rp becomes EGFR.\n\nShc has no \'name\' or references, so I leave it as Shc.\n\nRp_Shc, from the product, the reference is EGFR.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, then refine it using references. Also, I should include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Prioritize the `name` column over `references` for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided, there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is Di00UU + L => DiL00UU; Di00UU, L. The replacement table has four entries.\n\nLet\'s go through each row in the replacement table:\n\n1. **Di00UU**: The role is reactants, id is Di00UU, name is Di00UU, references is EGFR. Since the name is the same as the id, and the reference is EGFR, which is a well-known receptor. So, I should map Di00UU to EGFR. Since it\'s a receptor, maybe I should write it as EGFR_R? But the guidelines say to use the name column if possible. The name is Di00UU, but the reference is EGFR. Hmm, but the guidelines mention that if the name isn\'t specific, use the reference. So perhaps I should map Di00UU to EGFR_R because it\'s a receptor.\n\n2. **L**: Role is reactants, id is L, name is L, reference is EGF. So L stands for EGF, which is a ligand. So I should map L to EGF_L.\n\n3. **DiL00UU**: Role is products, id is DiL00UU, name is DiL00UU, no references. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely a complex of Di00UU and L. So combining EGFR and EGF, it would be EGFR_EGF.\n\n4. **Modifiers**: There are two more entries for Di00UU and L, both modifiers. I think these are the same as the reactants, so their mappings would be the same: Di00UU as EGFR_R and L as EGF_L.\n\nWait, but the modifiers might refer to the same entities, so their terms are the same as in reactants.

biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, I might need a two-step process: first map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the replacement table, then refine it using the references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x55 + x77 => x80. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s examine each one.\n\nStarting with x55: The role is reactant, id is x55, name is ERK, and reference is MAPK1. ERK is a common abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is part of the MAPK family. The reference MAPK1 confirms this. So, ERK is straightforward and doesn\'t need any changes. I\'ll map x55 to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x77: It\'s also a reactant, id x77, name MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1. MEK is another kinase, specifically MAPK/ERK kinase. The ""i-PP"" suffix likely stands for the inactive, phosphorylated form. So MEKi-PP refers to the inactive, phosphorylated MEK. Since it\'s a specific state, I can keep it as ""MEKi-PP"" without any changes because it\'s already a biologically meaningful term.\n\nThen, x80: It\'s a product, id x80, name ERKi-MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1; MAPK1. The name suggests a complex of inactive ERK and inactive MEK, both in their phosphorylated states. The references point to MEK (MAP2K1) and ERK (MAPK1), which confirms the components. Since it\'s a complex, I can combine the terms with underscores, so it becomes ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word. For x55, ""ERK"" is fine. For x77, ""MEKi-PP"" is also a single term. For x80, combining ERKi and MEKi-PP with an underscore makes it a single term, ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI don\'t see any need for further changes because each term is either a standard abbreviation or clearly indicates its state. Also, I\'m following the guidelines by using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and only refining based on the references when necessary.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map x55 to ""ERK"", x77 to ""MEKi-PP"", and x80 to ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines they provided. Each term in the JSON must be a single word. I need to replace ambiguous terms using the replacement table. Sometimes, it might take two steps: first mapping id to name, then refining with references. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I connect them with an underscore. States like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be part of the term as well.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x80 => x81 + x77. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with x80. The role is reactants, id is x80, name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, and references are MAP2K1; MAPK1. So, ERKi is probably ERK inhibitor, and MEKi is MEK inhibitor. The PP might stand for phosphorylated or something similar. But looking at the references, MAP2K1 is MEK1, and MAPK1 is ERK2. So ERKi-MEKi-PP could be referring to the inactive form of both ERK and MEK. So maybe the term is ERKi_MEKi active, since it\'s a reactant, implying it\'s active in the pathway.\n\nNext is x81. It\'s a product, id x81, name ERKi-P, reference MAPK1. ERK inhibitor with a phosphate? Or maybe P stands for phosphorylated. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form. So perhaps ERKi_active, but since the name is ERKi-P, maybe just ERKi_P. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, we don\'t change much. But ERKi-P might not be clear. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe it\'s ERK2_P. But the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERKi_P is better.\n\nThen x77. It\'s a product, id x77, name MEKi-PP, reference MAP2K1. MEK inhibitor with PP. Again, PP could be phosphorylated. So MEKi-PP might be the active form, so MEKi_active. Or perhaps MEKPP? But considering the references, it\'s MAP2K1, which is MEK1. So maybe MEK1_PP. But the name is MEKi-PP, so perhaps MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but looking back, the equation is x80 turning into x81 and x77. So x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP, which might be the active form of both inhibitors. So when it\'s consumed, it produces x81 (ERKi-P) and x77 (MEKi-PP). So perhaps x81 is ERKi in an active state, and x77 is MEKi in a phosphorylated or active state.\n\nSo mapping each id:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP. The name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, but references are MEK1 and ERK2. Maybe it\'s ERKi_MEKi_active or something. But the term should be single word. Hmm, maybe ERKi_MEKi_active, but that\'s three words. Alternatively, just use the name as is since it\'s interpretable. Or maybe split into ERKi and MEKi, but the id is x80, which is a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change much. So maybe keep it as ERKi_MEKi active? No, needs to be single word. Alternatively, ERKiMEKi_active. But that\'s a bit forced. Maybe just ERKi_MEKi, but the state is active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. But that\'s three words. Alternatively, perhaps the term is ERKi_MEKi_pp (pp for phosphorylated), but the name is ERKi-MEKi-PP. So maybe ERKi_MEKi_pp.\n\nBut looking at the output example, the user provided x80: ERKi_MEKi_active, x81: ERKi_P, x77: MEKi_active. So perhaps x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP being active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. x81 is ERKi-P, so ERKi_P. x77 is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_active.\n\nWait, but MEKi-PP could mean MEK inhibitor phosphorylated. So maybe MEKi_pp. But in the output, it\'s MEKi_active. Hmm. I think the key is to use the name as the base, then add state if necessary.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP → ERKi_MEKi_active\n\nx81: ERKi-P → ERKi_P\n\nx77: MEKi-PP → MEKi_active\n\nThat\'s the JSON they provided. So I think that\'s the correct mapping.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones.

Sometimes, I might need a two-step process: first map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the replacement table, then refine it using the references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency and clarity, especially when there are synonyms in the references.\n\nNow, looking at the input data. The equation is x55 + x51 => x56. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. x55 is ERK with a reference to MAPK1.\n2. x51 is MEK-PP with a reference to MAP2K1.\n3. x56 is ERK-MEK-PP with references to both MAPK1 and MAP2K1.\n\nStarting with x55, the name is ERK, which is a well-known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The reference is MAPK1, which is the full name. Since ERK is widely recognized and concise, I don\'t need to change it. So, x55 maps to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x51 is MEK-PP. MEK stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and the ""-PP"" likely stands for phosphorylated. The reference is MAP2K1, which is the full name for MEK. So, I should consider combining MEK and its state. Since the state is part of the name, I can include it. So, x51 becomes ""MEK-PP"".\n\nMoving on to x56, the name is ERK-MEK-PP, and the references are both MAPK1 and MAP2K1. Here, ERK is MAPK1, and MEK-PP is MAP2K1. Since ERK and MEK-PP are already part of the name, I should map this as a single term. However, considering the references, it\'s a complex of both proteins. But the guidelines suggest that if the name is already interpretable, minimal changes are needed. So, I can map x56 directly to ""ERK-MEK-PP"".\n\nI don\'t see any need to add states like ""bound"" or ""active"" unless indicated. The names are already specific enough. Also, since the names are concise and well-known abbreviations, they fit the single-word requirement when considering the entire term as a single unit.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have keys x55, x51, and x56, with their respective biologically interpretable terms. I don\'t need to add any underscores beyond what\'s already in the names because each term is a single word or a concise combination.\n\nSo, the final JSON would look like:\n{\n  ""x55"": ""ERK"",\n  ""x51"": ""MEK-PP"",\n  ""x56"": ""ERK-MEK-PP""\n}\n\nI think this meets all the guidelines: single words where possible, using the names from the table, and considering the references for accuracy without overcomplicating the terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines they provided. Each term in the JSON must be a single word. I need to replace ambiguous terms using the replacement table. Sometimes, it might take two steps: first mapping id to name, then refining with references. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I connect them with an underscore. States like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be part of the term as well.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x80 => x81 + x77. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with x80. The role is reactants, id is x80, name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, and references are MAP2K1; MAPK1. So, ERKi is probably ERK inhibitor, and MEKi is MEK inhibitor. The PP might stand for phosphorylated or something similar. But looking at the references, MAP2K1 is MEK1, and MAPK1 is ERK2. So ERKi-MEKi-PP could be referring to the inactive form of both ERK and MEK. So maybe the term is ERKi_MEKi active, since it\'s a reactant, implying it\'s active in the pathway.\n\nNext is x81. It\'s a product, id x81, name ERKi-P, reference MAPK1. ERK inhibitor with a phosphate? Or maybe P stands for phosphorylated. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form. So perhaps ERKi_active, but since the name is ERKi-P, maybe just ERKi_P. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, we don\'t change much. But ERKi-P might not be clear. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe it\'s ERK2_P. But the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERKi_P is better.\n\nThen x77. It\'s a product, id x77, name MEKi-PP, reference MAP2K1. MEK inhibitor with PP. Again, PP could be phosphorylated. So MEKi-PP might be the active form, so MEKi_active. Or perhaps MEKPP? But considering the references, it\'s MAP2K1, which is MEK1. So maybe MEK1_PP. But the name is MEKi-PP, so perhaps MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but looking back, the equation is x80 turning into x81 and x77. So x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP, which might be the active form of both inhibitors. So when it\'s consumed, it produces x81 (ERKi-P) and x77 (MEKi-PP). So perhaps x81 is ERKi in an active state, and x77 is MEKi in a phosphorylated or active state.\n\nSo mapping each id:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP. The name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, but references are MEK1 and ERK2. Maybe it\'s ERKi_MEKi_active or something. But the term should be single word. Hmm, maybe ERKi_MEKi_active, but that\'s three words. Alternatively, just use the name as is since it\'s interpretable. Or maybe split into ERKi and MEKi, but the id is x80, which is a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change much. So maybe keep it as ERKi_MEKi active? No, needs to be single word. Alternatively, ERKiMEKi_active. But that\'s a bit forced. Maybe just ERKi_MEKi, but the state is active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. But that\'s three words. Alternatively, perhaps the term is ERKi_MEKi_pp (pp for phosphorylated), but the name is ERKi-MEKi-PP. So maybe ERKi_MEKi_pp.\n\nBut looking at the output example, the user provided x80: ERKi_MEKi_active, x81: ERKi_P, x77: MEKi_active. So perhaps x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP being active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. x81 is ERKi-P, so ERKi_P. x77 is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_active.\n\nWait, but MEKi-PP could mean MEK inhibitor phosphorylated. So maybe MEKi_pp. But in the output, it\'s MEKi_active. Hmm. I think the key is to use the name as the base, then add state if necessary.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP → ERKi_MEKi_active\n\nx81: ERKi-P → ERKi_P\n\nx77: MEKi-PP → MEKi_active\n\nThat\'s the JSON they provided. So I think that\'s the correct mapping.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see what I have here.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: x77 + x81 => x82. The replacement table has three entries, each with role, id, name, and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For x77, the name is MEKi-PP, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEKi is an inhibitor of MEK, which is MAP2K1. MEK is a kinase, so MEKi-PP might be the phosphorylated form of the inhibitor. But I need to make it a single word. Maybe MEK1i_P? Because MEK is MAP2K1, which is MEK1.\n\n- For x81, the name is ERKi-P, and the reference is MAPK1. ERK is MAPK, so ERKi is an inhibitor of ERK. ERKi-P would be the phosphorylated form of the ERK inhibitor. So maybe ERK1i_P? Since MAPK1 is ERK2, but sometimes ERK1 and ERK2 are used interchangeably. Maybe just ERK_i_P, but the guidelines say to use the name if it\'s clear. So perhaps ERKi_P is acceptable, but since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe ERK2_i_P. Hmm, but the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERK_i_P might be better, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, ERKi_P as a single word.\n\n- For x82, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, and references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. So it\'s a complex of ERKi-P and MEKi-PP. So the product would combine both. Following the guidelines, I should combine them with an underscore. So maybe ERKi_P_MEK1i_P. But wait, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But the references are MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAP2K1 (MEK1). So perhaps ERK2_i_P_MEK1_i_P? That\'s a bit long, but the user wants a single word. Alternatively, use the names from the id mappings. Since x81 is ERKi-P, and x77 is MEKi-PP, the product would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But I\'m not sure if that\'s the best way. Maybe the user expects the product to be a combination of the two, so perhaps ERK_i_P_MEK1i_P, but I\'m not entirely certain.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. But in this case, these are inhibitors, not receptors or ligands. So perhaps just combine the names as they are. So x77 is MEKi-PP, x81 is ERKi-P, so x82 would be ERKi-P-MEKi-PP. But I need to make it a single word, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. Alternatively, using the more specific names from the references: MAP2K1 is MEK1, so MEK1i_P, and MAPK1 is ERK2, so ERK2i_P. So maybe ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P. But the name in the replacement table is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so I think it\'s better to follow the name as much as possible, but map the ids to their terms.\n\nSo for x77, id is x77, name is MEKi-PP, reference is MAP2K1. MAP2K1 is MEK1, so MEK1i_P.\n\nFor x81, id is x81, name is ERKi-P, reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, so ERK2i_P.\n\nFor x82, id is x82, name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, which combines x81 and x77. So ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P.\n\nBut the user\'s example used underscores and kept the terms as per the name, so maybe just ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nI think I\'ll go with:\n\n""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example used the name terms. So for x77, name is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_P. For x81, name is ERKi-P, so ERKi_P. For x82, name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEKi_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERKi_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERKi_P_MEKi_PP""\n}\n\nBut the references suggest using the more specific names. So maybe MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n}\n\nBut the user\'s example used the names as given, so maybe it\'s better to stick with the names unless the references provide more specificity that\'s needed.\n\nIn the initial example, R becomes IL6_R, which is specific. So in this case, since the references are specific (MAP2K1 is MEK1, MAPK1 is ERK2), perhaps using the specific forms is better.\n\nSo final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure because the names are more generic (MEKi-PP vs MEK1i-PP). The user\'s guidelines say to use the name unless the reference provides a better term. So perhaps I should prioritize the name, making it MEKi_P and ERKi_P, and the product ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nAlternatively, since the references give specific proteins, it\'s better to use MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P.\n\nI think the correct approach is to use the more specific terms from the references, so I\'ll go with MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P for x77 and x81, and their combination for x82.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: pERK2 => ppERK2; ppMEK1. The replacement table has three rows with roles, ids, names, and references.\n\nLet\'s go through each id:\n\n1. **pERK2**: The role is reactants, id is pERK2, name is empty, and references point to MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00048; MAPK1. Since the name is empty, I need to use the references. MOD%3A00048 might correspond to something, but I\'m not sure. The name column is empty, so maybe I should use the id as-is because it\'s a simple abbreviation. So, pERK2 would stay as ""pERK2"".\n\n2. **ppERK2**: Role is products, id is ppERK2, name is empty. References are MOD%3A00047 and MOD%3A00048; MAPK1. Again, the name is empty, so I\'ll use the id as is, giving ""ppERK2"".\n\n3. **ppMEK1**: Role is modifiers, id is ppMEK1, name is empty. References are MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00047; MAP2K1. Name is empty, so I\'ll stick with the id, resulting in ""ppMEK1"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. So, in this case, since all the names are empty, I just map each id to itself.\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands here, so no need to combine with underscores. Also, there\'s no mention of states like bound or active, so I don\'t need to add those either.\n\nSo the final JSON would map each id to its own value. That makes sense because without names or additional context, the ids are the best we can do.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

They mentioned that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to look for such cases in the replacement table.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries: x51, x57, and x58. Each has an id, name, and references. Let\'s start with x51. The name is MEK-PP, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEK is a well-known kinase, specifically MAPK/ERK kinase. The ""PP"" likely stands for phosphorylated. So, MEK-PP is phosphorylated MEK. Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, according to the guidelines, I shouldn\'t make significant changes unless necessary. So, I\'ll map x51 to ""MEKPP"".\n\nNext is x57, which is ERK-P with the reference MAPK1. ERK-P indicates phosphorylated ERK. Similar to MEK-PP, this is a straightforward abbreviation. So, I\'ll map x57 to ""ERK_P"".\n\nNow, x58 has the name ERK-P-MEK-PP and references MAPK1 and MAP2K1. This seems to be a complex where ERK-P is bound to MEK-PP. Following the guideline, if the term can be a single word by combining receptor and ligand with an underscore, I should do that. So, combining ERK_P and MEKPP with an underscore gives me ""ERK_P_MEKPP"".\n\nI should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" but in this case, the terms already include the phosphorylated state, so adding ""bound"" might not be necessary unless specified. Since the name is ERK-P-MEK-PP, it implies a bound state, so ""ERK_P_MEKPP"" suffices.\n\nI need to ensure that I\'m prioritizing the name column for consistency, as per the guidelines. The references might have synonyms, but the names are straightforward abbreviations, so I don\'t need to change them much.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its respective term without any additional comments or explanations.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s go through each one.\n\nThe first row has id ERK2, no name, and reference MAPK1. Since the name is empty, I should use the reference. MAPK1 is the name, so ERK2 maps to MAPK1. Since it\'s a single word, no changes needed.\n\nThe second row is pERK2 with references including MOD%3A00048 and MAPK1. The name is empty, so again, I use the reference. The primary term here is MAPK1, so pERK2 becomes pMAPK1. It\'s a single word, so that\'s good.\n\nThe third row is ppMEK1. The name is empty, and references include MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00047, with the name MAP2K1. So ppMEK1 should map to ppMAP2K1. That\'s a single word with the pp indicating phosphorylation.\n\nI need to make sure I\'m not adding any extra info, just the JSON object. So the output should have keys ERK2, pERK2, and ppMEK1, each mapped to their respective terms. I think that\'s all.

If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any receptors or ligands mentioned. The terms are more about kinases and their phosphorylated states. So maybe I don\'t need to create those kinds of terms here. \n\nThe user also noted that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name`, then refine using references. The equation given is x58 => x59 + x51. The replacement table has ERK-P-MEK-PP for x58, ERK-PP for x59, and MEK-PP for x51. The references for x58 are MAPK1 and MAP2K1, which are ERK and MEK respectively.\n\nSo, I need to map each id to a biologically accurate term. For x58, the name is ERK-P-MEK-PP. Since ERK is MAPK1 and MEK is MAP2K1, the phosphorylated forms are ERK-PP and MEK-PP. Therefore, ERK-P-MEK-PP would be the combination of these two, which is ERK-PP and MEK-PP.\n\nBut the output example they provided just maps each id to their respective names. So x58 becomes ERK_P_MEK_PP, x59 is ERK_PP, and x51 is MEK_PP. They used underscores instead of hyphens, which makes sense for a JSON key.\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, so replacing hyphens with underscores is appropriate.

The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s examine each one.\n\nStarting with x55: The role is reactant, id is x55, name is ERK, and reference is MAPK1. ERK is a common abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is part of the MAPK family. The reference MAPK1 confirms this. So, ERK is straightforward and doesn\'t need any changes. I\'ll map x55 to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x77: It\'s also a reactant, id x77, name MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1. MEK is another kinase, specifically MAPK/ERK kinase. The ""i-PP"" suffix likely stands for the inactive, phosphorylated form. So MEKi-PP refers to the inactive, phosphorylated MEK. Since it\'s a specific state, I can keep it as ""MEKi-PP"" without any changes because it\'s already a biologically meaningful term.\n\nThen, x80: It\'s a product, id x80, name ERKi-MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1; MAPK1. The name suggests a complex of inactive ERK and inactive MEK, both in their phosphorylated states. The references point to MEK (MAP2K1) and ERK (MAPK1), which confirms the components. Since it\'s a complex, I can combine the terms with underscores, so it becomes ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word. For x55, ""ERK"" is fine. For x77, ""MEKi-PP"" is also a single term. For x80, combining ERKi and MEKi-PP with an underscore makes it a single term, ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI don\'t see any need for further changes because each term is either a standard abbreviation or clearly indicates its state. Also, I\'m following the guidelines by using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and only refining based on the references when necessary.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map x55 to ""ERK"", x77 to ""MEKi-PP"", and x80 to ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The guidelines suggest that if the name is already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. Also, the priority is to use the \'name\' column for consistency unless I need to refine it further.\n\nStarting with x56: ERK-MEK-PP. The names ERK and MEK are well-known abbreviations. ERK stands for Extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and MEK is Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. The \'PP\' likely stands for phosphorylated. So, ERK-MEK-PP suggests a complex where both are phosphorylated.\n\nThe references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. MAPK1 corresponds to ERK, and MAP2K1 is MEK. So, ERK-MEK-PP is a complex of phosphorylated ERK and MEK.\n\nSince the name is already specific and interpretable, I might just use it as is. But the guidelines say if it\'s simple, leave it. So, maybe x56 maps to ""ERK-MEK-PP"".\n\nNext, x51 is MEK-PP, which is MAP2K1. This is the phosphorylated form of MEK. The name is straightforward, so I can map x51 to ""MEK-PP"".\n\nThen, x57 is ERK-P, which is MAPK1. This is the phosphorylated ERK. Again, the name is clear, so I can map x57 to ""ERK-P"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a term can be a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. But in this case, ERK and MEK are kinases, not receptors or ligands. So, that part doesn\'t apply here.\n\nAlso, the equation shows that x56 breaks down into x51 and x57, which makes sense biologically as the ERK-MEK complex dissociates into its components upon dephosphorylation or something similar.\n\nI don\'t think I need to add any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" because the names already include the phosphorylation state with ""PP"" and ""P"". So, no further modifications are needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to its respective term as per the name column, since they are already biologically interpretable and specific enough.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines carefully.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words, so I need to think about how to combine terms if necessary. They mentioned that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to look for such cases in the replacement table.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries: x51, x57, and x58. Each has an id, name, and references. Let\'s start with x51. The name is MEK-PP, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEK is a well-known kinase, specifically MAPK/ERK kinase. The ""PP"" likely stands for phosphorylated. So, MEK-PP is phosphorylated MEK. Since it\'s a simple abbreviation, according to the guidelines, I shouldn\'t make significant changes unless necessary. So, I\'ll map x51 to ""MEKPP"".\n\nNext is x57, which is ERK-P with the reference MAPK1. ERK-P indicates phosphorylated ERK. Similar to MEK-PP, this is a straightforward abbreviation. So, I\'ll map x57 to ""ERK_P"".\n\nNow, x58 has the name ERK-P-MEK-PP and references MAPK1 and MAP2K1. This seems to be a complex where ERK-P is bound to MEK-PP. Following the guideline, if the term can be a single word by combining receptor and ligand with an underscore, I should do that. So, combining ERK_P and MEKPP with an underscore gives me ""ERK_P_MEKPP"".\n\nI should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" but in this case, the terms already include the phosphorylated state, so adding ""bound"" might not be necessary unless specified. Since the name is ERK-P-MEK-PP, it implies a bound state, so ""ERK_P_MEKPP"" suffices.\n\nI need to ensure that I\'m prioritizing the name column for consistency, as per the guidelines. The references might have synonyms, but the names are straightforward abbreviations, so I don\'t need to change them much.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its respective term without any additional comments or explanations.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher.

Since it's a reactant, I think this might be a complex of ERK and MEK in their phosphorylated and inhibited states. ERK is MAPK1, and MEK is MAP2K1. So maybe the term should combine both, indicating they are inhibited and phosphorylated. I'll go with ERK_i_P_MEK_i_P, using underscores to connect them clearly.\n\n- Next, x83 has the name ERKi-PP and reference MAPK1. ERK inhibited and phosphorylated.

MEKi is an inhibitor of MEK, which is MAP2K1. MEK is a kinase, so MEKi-PP might be the phosphorylated form of the inhibitor. But I need to make it a single word. Maybe MEK1i_P? Because MEK is MAP2K1, which is MEK1.\n\n- For x81, the name is ERKi-P, and the reference is MAPK1. ERK is MAPK, so ERKi is an inhibitor of ERK. ERKi-P would be the phosphorylated form of the ERK inhibitor. So maybe ERK1i_P? Since MAPK1 is ERK2, but sometimes ERK1 and ERK2 are used interchangeably. Maybe just ERK_i_P, but the guidelines say to use the name if it\'s clear. So perhaps ERKi_P is acceptable, but since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe ERK2_i_P. Hmm, but the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERK_i_P might be better, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, ERKi_P as a single word.\n\n- For x82, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, and references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. So it\'s a complex of ERKi-P and MEKi-PP. So the product would combine both. Following the guidelines, I should combine them with an underscore. So maybe ERKi_P_MEK1i_P. But wait, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But the references are MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAP2K1 (MEK1). So perhaps ERK2_i_P_MEK1_i_P? That\'s a bit long, but the user wants a single word. Alternatively, use the names from the id mappings. Since x81 is ERKi-P, and x77 is MEKi-PP, the product would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But I\'m not sure if that\'s the best way. Maybe the user expects the product to be a combination of the two, so perhaps ERK_i_P_MEK1i_P, but I\'m not entirely certain.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. But in this case, these are inhibitors, not receptors or ligands. So perhaps just combine the names as they are. So x77 is MEKi-PP, x81 is ERKi-P, so x82 would be ERKi-P-MEKi-PP. But I need to make it a single word, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. Alternatively, using the more specific names from the references: MAP2K1 is MEK1, so MEK1i_P, and MAPK1 is ERK2, so ERK2i_P. So maybe ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P. But the name in the replacement table is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so I think it\'s better to follow the name as much as possible, but map the ids to their terms.\n\nSo for x77, id is x77, name is MEKi-PP, reference is MAP2K1. MAP2K1 is MEK1, so MEK1i_P.\n\nFor x81, id is x81, name is ERKi-P, reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, so ERK2i_P.\n\nFor x82, id is x82, name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, which combines x81 and x77. So ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P.\n\nBut the user\'s example used underscores and kept the terms as per the name, so maybe just ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nI think I\'ll go with:\n\n""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example used the name terms.

For x82, name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEKi_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERKi_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERKi_P_MEKi_PP""\n}\n\nBut the references suggest using the more specific names. So maybe MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P.\n\nSo perhaps:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n}\n\nBut the user\'s example used the names as given, so maybe it\'s better to stick with the names unless the references provide more specificity that\'s needed.\n\nIn the initial example, R becomes IL6_R, which is specific. So in this case, since the references are specific (MAP2K1 is MEK1, MAPK1 is ERK2), perhaps using the specific forms is better.\n\nSo final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEK1i_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERK2i_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure because the names are more generic (MEKi-PP vs MEK1i-PP). The user\'s guidelines say to use the name unless the reference provides a better term. So perhaps I should prioritize the name, making it MEKi_P and ERKi_P, and the product ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nAlternatively, since the references give specific proteins, it\'s better to use MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P.\n\nI think the correct approach is to use the more specific terms from the references, so I\'ll go with MEK1i_P and ERK2i_P for x77 and x81, and their combination for x82.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher.

Since phosphorylation is a common modification, and the reference is the same gene as ERK, it makes sense to use ""pERK"" as it\'s a specific state of ERK. The guidelines allow adding states like ""active"" or ""bound"" with an underscore. However, ""pERK"" is already a standard abbreviation, so I think it\'s acceptable as a single word. So, species_10 maps to ""pERK"".\n\nThird row:\n- Role: modifiers\n- id: species_8\n- name: Mek_Active\n- references: MAP2K1\n\nMEK is Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, which is the MAP2K family. The name here is ""Mek_Active"", and the reference is MAP2K1, which is the gene for MEK1. The guidelines suggest if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. However, MEK is an enzyme, not a receptor or ligand. The term ""Mek_Active"" indicates the active form of MEK. Since the guidelines allow including states like ""active"" by joining with an underscore, this seems appropriate. So, species_8 maps to ""Mek_Active"".\n\nI should also check if any terms need to be changed based on context or references. For example, sometimes terms might have multiple meanings, but in this case, ERK, pERK, and MEK are pretty specific. The names from the replacement table are already in a biologically interpretable form, so I don\'t think further changes are necessary.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have keys as the ids and values as the mapped terms. So, the final JSON would be:\n{\n  ""species_11"": ""ERK"",\n  ""species_10"": ""pERK"",\n  ""species_8"": ""Mek_Active""\n}\n\nI don\'t think I need to make any further changes. All terms are single words or appropriately formatted with underscores, and they accurately represent the biological entities based on the replacement table.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines they provided. Each term in the JSON must be a single word. I need to replace ambiguous terms with more specific ones using the replacement table. If I can identify a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nNow, looking at the input equation: X22 => X23; X21. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. X22 is ERK with references to MAPK1.\n2. X23 is ERK_ast with references to MAPK1.\n3. X21 is MEK_ast with references to MAP2K1.\n\nI need to map each id to a biologically interpretable term. Starting with X22: the name is ERK, and the reference is MAPK1. ERK is a common abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is MAPK1. Since ERK is a well-known term and the name column uses ""ERK"", I should keep it as is unless there\'s a need for more specificity. But the guidelines say if it\'s reasonably interpretable, don\'t change it. So X22 should map to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, X23 is ERK_ast. The reference is also MAPK1. The ""_ast"" probably stands for ""activated"". So I need to make it a single word. Following the guideline, I can add the state with an underscore. So X23 should be ""ERK_active"".\n\nThen, X21 is MEK_ast, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEK stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, which is MAP2K1. The ""_ast"" again suggests activation. So I should map X21 to ""MEK_active"".\n\nI need to make sure I\'m not adding any explanations, just the JSON. So the output should be a JSON object with keys as X21, X22, X23, and their respective terms.\n\nWait, let me double-check. For X23, the name is ERK_ast. So the term is ERK with an active state. I think ""ERK_active"" is correct. Similarly, MEK_ast becomes ""MEK_active"". There\'s no mention of receptors or ligands here, so no underscores needed beyond the state.\n\nI think that\'s it. I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should use the replacement table and any references to make it more precise.\n\nLooking at their example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, when there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be added as part of the term, joined by underscores. For instance, ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe user provided an input equation: ppMEK_ERK => ppERK + ppMEK. They also gave a replacement table with three rows. Let me look at that.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries:\n1. Role: reactants, id: ppMEK_ERK, name: empty, references: MAP2K1; MAPK1\n2. Role: products, id: ppERK, name: empty, references: MAPK1\n3. Role: products, id: ppMEK, name: empty, references: MAP2K1\n\nHmm, so the names are empty. That complicates things because I usually use the name column for mapping. But the guidelines say if the name is empty, I should use context and references. So, I\'ll have to rely on the references here.\n\nStarting with ppMEK_ERK. The references are MAP2K1 and MAPK1. I know that MEK is MAPK/ERK kinase, which is MAP2K, and ERK is MAPK1 or MAPK3. So, ppMEK_ERK is a complex involving both MEK and ERK in their phosphorylated states. Since it\'s a complex, I should combine their terms. So, I\'ll use the receptor and ligand approach, connecting them with an underscore. So, it would be ""MAP2K1_MAPK1"".\n\nNext, ppERK. The reference is MAPK1. So, ERK is MAPK1, and pp stands for phosphorylated. So, the term would be ""MAPK1"" but with the state. Since the id is ppERK, the state is phosphorylated, so I\'ll add ""_p"" for phosphorylated. So, ""MAPK1_p"".\n\nSimilarly, ppMEK. The reference is MAP2K1. MEK is MAP2K1, so phosphorylated MEK would be ""MAP2K1_p"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used underscores for combining receptor and ligand, but here it\'s a complex. So, maybe ""ppMEK_ERK"" should be ""MAP2K1_MAPK1"" as a complex, and then the products are the individual phosphorylated forms.\n\nI think that\'s the right approach. So, the JSON would map each id to their respective terms, combining when necessary and adding states where appropriate.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words, so I need to think about how to combine terms if necessary. The example given was replacing ""R"" with ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" with ""CSF1R_L"". So, if an id is an abbreviation, I might need to expand it into a more specific term using underscores.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, I see three entries: MAPK_cyto, MAPK_active_cyto, and MEK_active_cyto. The task is to map each `id` to a biologically accurate term.\n\nStarting with MAPK_cyto. The `name` column is empty, but the `reference` is MAPK1. MAPK stands for Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase. Since the `name` is empty, I should use the reference. MAPK1 is a specific isoform, so maybe the term should be MAPK1_cyto? But the guideline says if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it unless necessary. Since MAPK is a well-known term, perhaps keeping it as MAPK is acceptable, but including the cyto (cytoplasmic) location is important. So maybe MAPK_cyto is fine as is.\n\nNext, MAPK_active_cyto. The `name` is also empty, and the reference is MAPK1. Here, the term includes ""active"" and ""cyto."" So, combining these, it should be MAPK_active_cyto. Since the `name` is empty, we rely on the reference, which is the same as before. So the term remains the same, but perhaps we can make it more specific by using MAPK1? But the guideline says if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So I\'ll stick with MAPK_active_cyto.\n\nLastly, MEK_active_cyto. The `name` is empty, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEK is an abbreviation for Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase, which is MAP2K. The specific isoform here is MAP2K1, which is also known as MEK1. So, the term could be MEK1_active_cyto, but since the `name` is empty, and the id is MEK_active_cyto, which is already specific enough, perhaps it\'s better to keep it as MEK_active_cyto. Alternatively, using the reference, it\'s MAP2K1, so maybe MAP2K1_active_cyto? But the guideline says to prioritize the `name` column if possible. Since the `name` is empty, we have to use the reference. So, perhaps the term should be MAP2K1_active_cyto.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example had ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becoming ""CSF1R_L"", so they combined the ligand and receptor. In this case, the replacements are more about states and locations. So, for MEK_active_cyto, since the reference is MAP2K1, but the id is MEK_active_cyto, perhaps we should keep it as MEK_active_cyto because it\'s a standard abbreviation, and the term is interpretable.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term, considering the guidelines. So:\n\n- MAPK_cyto maps to MAPK1_cyto? Or just MAPK_cyto? Since the `name` is empty, but the reference is MAPK1. Maybe the term should be MAPK1_cyto for specificity.\n- MAPK_active_cyto would then be MAPK1_active_cyto.\n- MEK_active_cyto would be MAP2K1_active_cyto.\n\nBut the user\'s example didn\'t change the abbreviation when the `name` was present. Wait, in the example, the `name` was ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so they used the `name` column. In our case, the `name` is empty, so we have to use the reference. So for MAPK_cyto, since the reference is MAPK1, we should use MAPK1_cyto. Similarly, MAPK_active_cyto becomes MAPK1_active_cyto, and MEK_active_cyto becomes MAP2K1_active_cyto.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example kept the abbreviation when the `name` was present. So in our case, since the `name` is empty, perhaps we should use the reference. So the mapping would be:\n\n{\n  ""MAPK_cyto"": ""MAPK1_cyto"",\n  ""MAPK_active_cyto"": ""MAPK1_active_cyto"",\n  ""MEK_active_cyto"": ""MAP2K1_active_cyto""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s what the user wants. Alternatively, if the id is already a common abbreviation, perhaps we keep it as is. Since MAPK and MEK are well-known abbreviations, maybe it\'s better to keep them. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""MAPK_cyto"": ""MAPK_cyto"",\n  ""MAPK_active_cyto"": ""MAPK_active_cyto"",\n  ""MEK_active_cyto"": ""MEK_active_cyto""\n}\n\nBut the references suggest using the specific gene names. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the references to get the specific gene symbols. So MAPK_cyto becomes MAPK1_cyto, MAPK_active_cyto becomes MAPK1_active_cyto, and MEK_active_cyto becomes MAP2K1_active_cyto.\n\nI think that\'s the right approach because the guidelines say to use the references when the `name` is ambiguous or not provided. So the JSON should reflect the specific gene symbols from the references, combined with the state and location from the id.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is x3 => x3p; x2p. The replacement table has three rows:\n\n- role: reactants, id: x3, name: (empty), references: MAPK1\n- role: products, id: x3p, name: (empty), references: MAPK1\n- role: modifiers, id: x2p, name: (empty), references: MAP2K1\n\nHmm, so the \'name\' column is empty for all entries. That means I can\'t rely on it for the term; I have to use the \'references\' column. \n\nFor x3 and x3p, the reference is MAPK1. Since both are referencing the same protein, I need to differentiate them. Since x3 is a reactant and x3p is a product, it\'s likely that x3p is the phosphorylated form. So, I can denote x3 as MAPK1 and x3p as MAPK1_p (where p stands for phosphorylated).\n\nFor x2p, the reference is MAP2K1. The role is a modifier, which often means it\'s an enzyme or a kinase. MAP2K1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, so it\'s a kinase that phosphorylates MAPK1. Since x2p is a modifier, it might be active in this reaction. So, I can denote it as MAP2K1_active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. So:\n\n- x3: MAPK1\n- x3p: MAPK1_p\n- x2p: MAP2K1_active\n\nI should make sure these are single words, which they are. I don\'t see any receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to use underscores for those.

I should prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency and clarity, especially when there are synonyms in the references.\n\nNow, looking at the input data. The equation is x55 + x51 => x56. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. x55 is ERK with a reference to MAPK1.\n2. x51 is MEK-PP with a reference to MAP2K1.\n3. x56 is ERK-MEK-PP with references to both MAPK1 and MAP2K1.\n\nStarting with x55, the name is ERK, which is a well-known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The reference is MAPK1, which is the full name. Since ERK is widely recognized and concise, I don\'t need to change it. So, x55 maps to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x51 is MEK-PP. MEK stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and the ""-PP"" likely stands for phosphorylated. The reference is MAP2K1, which is the full name for MEK. So, I should consider combining MEK and its state. Since the state is part of the name, I can include it. So, x51 becomes ""MEK-PP"".\n\nMoving on to x56, the name is ERK-MEK-PP, and the references are both MAPK1 and MAP2K1. Here, ERK is MAPK1, and MEK-PP is MAP2K1. Since ERK and MEK-PP are already part of the name, I should map this as a single term. However, considering the references, it\'s a complex of both proteins.

So MEK_ERK becomes MAPK1_MAP2K1.\n\nI should make sure each id is mapped correctly. ERK is MAPK1, MEK is MAP2K1, and MEK_ERK is the combination, so MAPK1_MAP2K1. That fits the guidelines, right?

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any receptors or ligands mentioned. The terms are more about kinases and their phosphorylated states.

The equation given is x58 => x59 + x51. The replacement table has ERK-P-MEK-PP for x58, ERK-PP for x59, and MEK-PP for x51. The references for x58 are MAPK1 and MAP2K1, which are ERK and MEK respectively.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to their respective terms. For x58, the name is ERK-P-MEK-PP. Since ERK is MAPK1 and MEK is MAP2K1, the term should combine both. Maybe it\'s ""ERK_P_MEK_PP""? That\'s a single word with underscores connecting the parts. \n\nFor x59, the name is ERK-PP, and the reference is MAPK1. So that should map directly to ""ERK-PP"". Similarly, x51 is MEK-PP, referenced to MAP2K1, so it\'s ""MEK-PP"". \n\nI should also consider if any terms need states like ""bound"" or ""active,"" but in this case, the terms are about phosphorylation states, so ""PP"" likely stands for doubly phosphorylated. \n\nI need to make sure I don\'t change the terms if they\'re already interpretable. Since ERK-PP and MEK-PP are standard abbreviations, I\'ll keep them as-is. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each `id` to the appropriate term. I think that\'s all.

ERK is a common abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is part of the MAPK family. The reference MAPK1 confirms this. So, ERK is straightforward and doesn\'t need any changes. I\'ll map x55 to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x77: It\'s also a reactant, id x77, name MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1. MEK is another kinase, specifically MAPK/ERK kinase. The ""i-PP"" suffix likely stands for the inactive, phosphorylated form. So MEKi-PP refers to the inactive, phosphorylated MEK. Since it\'s a specific state, I can keep it as ""MEKi-PP"" without any changes because it\'s already a biologically meaningful term.\n\nThen, x80: It\'s a product, id x80, name ERKi-MEKi-PP, and reference MAP2K1; MAPK1. The name suggests a complex of inactive ERK and inactive MEK, both in their phosphorylated states. The references point to MEK (MAP2K1) and ERK (MAPK1), which confirms the components. Since it\'s a complex, I can combine the terms with underscores, so it becomes ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word. For x55, ""ERK"" is fine. For x77, ""MEKi-PP"" is also a single term. For x80, combining ERKi and MEKi-PP with an underscore makes it a single term, ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".\n\nI don\'t see any need for further changes because each term is either a standard abbreviation or clearly indicates its state. Also, I\'m following the guidelines by using the \'name\' column\'s phrasing and only refining based on the references when necessary.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map x55 to ""ERK"", x77 to ""MEKi-PP"", and x80 to ""ERKi_MEKi-PP"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines they provided. Each term in the JSON must be a single word. I need to replace ambiguous terms using the replacement table. Sometimes, it might take two steps: first mapping id to name, then refining with references. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, I connect them with an underscore. States like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be part of the term as well.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is x80 => x81 + x77. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s break them down one by one.\n\nStarting with x80. The role is reactants, id is x80, name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, and references are MAP2K1; MAPK1. So, ERKi is probably ERK inhibitor, and MEKi is MEK inhibitor. The PP might stand for phosphorylated or something similar. But looking at the references, MAP2K1 is MEK1, and MAPK1 is ERK2. So ERKi-MEKi-PP could be referring to the inactive form of both ERK and MEK. So maybe the term is ERKi_MEKi active, since it\'s a reactant, implying it\'s active in the pathway.\n\nNext is x81. It\'s a product, id x81, name ERKi-P, reference MAPK1. ERK inhibitor with a phosphate? Or maybe P stands for phosphorylated. Since it\'s a product, it\'s likely the active form. So perhaps ERKi_active, but since the name is ERKi-P, maybe just ERKi_P. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s interpretable as-is, we don\'t change much. But ERKi-P might not be clear. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe it\'s ERK2_P. But the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERKi_P is better.\n\nThen x77. It\'s a product, id x77, name MEKi-PP, reference MAP2K1. MEK inhibitor with PP. Again, PP could be phosphorylated. So MEKi-PP might be the active form, so MEKi_active. Or perhaps MEKPP? But considering the references, it\'s MAP2K1, which is MEK1. So maybe MEK1_PP. But the name is MEKi-PP, so perhaps MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but looking back, the equation is x80 turning into x81 and x77. So x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP, which might be the active form of both inhibitors. So when it\'s consumed, it produces x81 (ERKi-P) and x77 (MEKi-PP). So perhaps x81 is ERKi in an active state, and x77 is MEKi in a phosphorylated or active state.\n\nSo mapping each id:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP. The name is ERKi-MEKi-PP, but references are MEK1 and ERK2. Maybe it\'s ERKi_MEKi_active or something. But the term should be single word. Hmm, maybe ERKi_MEKi_active, but that\'s three words. Alternatively, just use the name as is since it\'s interpretable. Or maybe split into ERKi and MEKi, but the id is x80, which is a single term.\n\nWait, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change much. So maybe keep it as ERKi_MEKi active? No, needs to be single word. Alternatively, ERKiMEKi_active. But that\'s a bit forced. Maybe just ERKi_MEKi, but the state is active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. But that\'s three words. Alternatively, perhaps the term is ERKi_MEKi_pp (pp for phosphorylated), but the name is ERKi-MEKi-PP. So maybe ERKi_MEKi_pp.\n\nBut looking at the output example, the user provided x80: ERKi_MEKi_active, x81: ERKi_P, x77: MEKi_active. So perhaps x80 is ERKi-MEKi-PP being active, so ERKi_MEKi_active. x81 is ERKi-P, so ERKi_P. x77 is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_active.\n\nWait, but MEKi-PP could mean MEK inhibitor phosphorylated. So maybe MEKi_pp. But in the output, it\'s MEKi_active. Hmm. I think the key is to use the name as the base, then add state if necessary.\n\nSo, to sum up:\n\nx80: ERKi-MEKi-PP → ERKi_MEKi_active\n\nx81: ERKi-P → ERKi_P\n\nx77: MEKi-PP → MEKi_active\n\nThat\'s the JSON they provided. So I think that\'s the correct mapping.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see what I have here.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: x77 + x81 => x82. The replacement table has three entries, each with role, id, name, and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For x77, the name is MEKi-PP, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEKi is an inhibitor of MEK, which is MAP2K1. MEK is a kinase, so MEKi-PP might be the phosphorylated form of the inhibitor. But I need to make it a single word. Maybe MEK1i_P? Because MEK is MAP2K1, which is MEK1.\n\n- For x81, the name is ERKi-P, and the reference is MAPK1. ERK is MAPK, so ERKi is an inhibitor of ERK. ERKi-P would be the phosphorylated form of the ERK inhibitor. So maybe ERK1i_P? Since MAPK1 is ERK2, but sometimes ERK1 and ERK2 are used interchangeably. Maybe just ERK_i_P, but the guidelines say to use the name if it\'s clear. So perhaps ERKi_P is acceptable, but since the reference is MAPK1, which is ERK2, maybe ERK2_i_P. Hmm, but the name is ERKi-P, so I think ERK_i_P might be better, but I\'m not sure. Alternatively, ERKi_P as a single word.\n\n- For x82, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, and references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. So it\'s a complex of ERKi-P and MEKi-PP. So the product would combine both. Following the guidelines, I should combine them with an underscore. So maybe ERKi_P_MEK1i_P. But wait, the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But the references are MAPK1 (ERK2) and MAP2K1 (MEK1). So perhaps ERK2_i_P_MEK1_i_P? That\'s a bit long, but the user wants a single word. Alternatively, use the names from the id mappings. Since x81 is ERKi-P, and x77 is MEKi-PP, the product would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. But I\'m not sure if that\'s the best way. Maybe the user expects the product to be a combination of the two, so perhaps ERK_i_P_MEK1i_P, but I\'m not entirely certain.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a simple receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. But in this case, these are inhibitors, not receptors or ligands. So perhaps just combine the names as they are. So x77 is MEKi-PP, x81 is ERKi-P, so x82 would be ERKi-P-MEKi-PP. But I need to make it a single word, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. Alternatively, using the reference proteins, it would be ERK2_i_P_MEK1_i_P, but that\'s a bit more precise.\n\nI think I should prioritize the names from the replacement table. So for x77, name is MEKi-PP, so maybe MEK1i_P because the reference is MAP2K1 (MEK1). For x81, name is ERKi-P, reference is MAPK1 (ERK2), so maybe ERK2i_P. Then for x82, combining both, it would be ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P. But the name is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so perhaps ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. Alternatively, to follow the guidelines, since the names are MEKi-PP and ERKi-P, the product would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used R and L as abbreviations. So in this case, perhaps the product is the combination of x81 and x77. So x82 is the product of x77 and x81, which are MEKi-PP and ERKi-P. So the product would be a complex of both, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Maybe I should look up if MEK inhibitors and ERK inhibitors form complexes. I know that in signaling pathways, MEK is upstream of ERK, so perhaps the inhibitors bind to these kinases. But in terms of biological terms, combining them as a complex might be appropriate.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nx77: MEKi-PP → Since the reference is MAP2K1 (MEK1), maybe MEK1i_P. But the name is MEKi-PP, so perhaps MEKi_P is acceptable, but considering the reference, MEK1i_P is more precise.\n\nx81: ERKi-P → Reference is MAPK1 (ERK2), so ERK2i_P. But the name is ERKi-P, so perhaps ERK_i_P or ERKi_P.\n\nx82: ERKi-P-MEKi-PP → Since it\'s a product of x77 and x81, maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP. Or using the references, ERK2i_P_MEK1i_P.\n\nBut the user\'s example used single words, so I think using the names as they are, but connected with underscores. So x77 becomes MEKi_P, x81 becomes ERKi_P, and x82 becomes ERKi_P_MEKi_P. Wait, but x77\'s name is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_PP. So x82 would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but in the example, R and L were connected with an underscore. So in this case, the product is a complex, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP is the way to go.\n\nI think I should follow the names as given, so x77 is MEKi-PP, which becomes MEKi_P, but considering the reference, maybe MEK1i_P. Similarly, x81 is ERKi-P, which becomes ERK_i_P or ERKi_P, but considering the reference, ERK2i_P.\n\nBut the user\'s guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So maybe x77 is MEKi_P, x81 is ERKi_P, and x82 is ERKi_P_MEKi_P. But the name for x82 is ERKi-P-MEKi-PP, so maybe ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nWait, but MEK inhibitor in its phosphorylated form is MEKi-PP, so MEKi_PP. So x82 would be ERKi_P_MEKi_PP.\n\nI think that\'s the way to go. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""x77"": ""MEKi_P"",\n  ""x81"": ""ERKi_P"",\n  ""x82"": ""ERKi_P_MEKi_PP""\n}\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example used R and L as abbreviations, so in this case, maybe I should look for specific receptor or ligand terms, but here they are inhibitors, so perhaps it\'s not applicable. So the terms are inhibitors in their phosphorylated forms.\n\nI think that\'s the best I can do. So I\'ll go with that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nThe input given is an equation: x56 => x51 + x57. So, x56 is a reactant, and x51 and x57 are products. The replacement table has three entries with their respective roles, ids, names, and references.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- x56 is ERK-MEK-PP with references MAPK1 and MAP2K1.\n- x51 is MEK-PP, reference MAP2K1.\n- x57 is ERK-P, reference MAPK1.\n\nI need to map each id (x56, x51, x57) to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines suggest that if the name is already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. Also, the priority is to use the \'name\' column for consistency unless I need to refine it further.\n\nStarting with x56: ERK-MEK-PP. The names ERK and MEK are well-known abbreviations. ERK stands for Extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and MEK is Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase. The \'PP\' likely stands for phosphorylated. So, ERK-MEK-PP suggests a complex where both are phosphorylated.\n\nThe references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. MAPK1 corresponds to ERK, and MAP2K1 is MEK. So, ERK-MEK-PP is a complex of phosphorylated ERK and MEK.\n\nSince the name is already specific and interpretable, I might just use it as is. But the guidelines say if it\'s simple, leave it. So, maybe x56 maps to ""ERK-MEK-PP"".\n\nNext, x51 is MEK-PP, which is MAP2K1. This is the phosphorylated form of MEK. The name is straightforward, so I can map x51 to ""MEK-PP"".\n\nThen, x57 is ERK-P, which is MAPK1. This is the phosphorylated ERK. Again, the name is clear, so I can map x57 to ""ERK-P"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a term can be a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. But in this case, ERK and MEK are kinases, not receptors or ligands. So, that part doesn\'t apply here.\n\nAlso, the equation shows that x56 breaks down into x51 and x57, which makes sense biologically as the ERK-MEK complex dissociates into its components upon dephosphorylation or something similar.\n\nI don\'t think I need to add any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" because the names already include the phosphorylation state with ""PP"" and ""P"". So, no further modifications are needed.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to its respective term as per the name column, since they are already biologically interpretable and specific enough.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

For example, if the id is \'R\', it becomes \'IL6_R\'.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, ERK has no name but the reference is MAPK1. So I should map ERK to MAPK1. Similarly, pMEK has no name but the reference is MAP2K1, so pMEK should map to MAP2K1. The product is pMEK_ERK, and the reference is both MAPK1 and MAP2K1. Since it\'s a product, it\'s a complex of both, so I should combine their names with an underscore, making it MAP2K1_MAPK1.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the name column is empty, I should use context and references. So for ERK and pMEK, since their names are empty, I directly use their references. The product\'s id is pMEK_ERK, and the references are both proteins, so combining them as a complex makes sense.\n\nI should also check if any terms need states like ""bound"" or ""active"", but in this case, the terms don\'t indicate such states, so I can ignore that part.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if the term is already interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it much. Here, ERK and pMEK are abbreviations, but since their names are empty, using the references is the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map ERK to MAPK1, pMEK to MAP2K1, and pMEK_ERK to MAP2K1_MAPK1. I think that covers all the guidelines without overcomplicating things.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input, there\'s an equation: species_11 => species_10; species_8. This probably represents a reaction where species_11 is a reactant turning into species_10, with species_8 as a modifier.\n\nThe replacement table has three rows. Each row has a role, id, name, and references. My goal is to map each id to a term that\'s biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nStarting with the first row:\n- Role: reactants\n- id: species_11\n- name: ERK\n- references: MAPK1\n\nERK is a well-known acronym for Extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The reference is MAPK1, which is the gene symbol for ERK. So, I think ERK is already a clear term. Since the guidelines say if the term is simple or interpretable as-is, we don\'t need to change it. So, species_11 maps to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, the second row:\n- Role: products\n- id: species_10\n- name: pERK\n- references: MAPK1\n\npERK stands for phosphorylated ERK. Since phosphorylation is a common modification, and the reference is the same gene as ERK, it makes sense to use ""pERK"" as it\'s a specific state of ERK. The guidelines allow adding states like ""active"" or ""bound"" with an underscore. However, ""pERK"" is already a standard abbreviation, so I think it\'s acceptable as a single word. So, species_10 maps to ""pERK"".\n\nThird row:\n- Role: modifiers\n- id: species_8\n- name: Mek_Active\n- references: MAP2K1\n\nMEK is Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, which is the MAP2K family. The name here is ""Mek_Active"", and the reference is MAP2K1, which is the gene for MEK1. The guidelines suggest if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. However, MEK is an enzyme, not a receptor or ligand. The term ""Mek_Active"" indicates the active form of MEK. Since the guidelines allow including states like ""active"" by joining with an underscore, this seems appropriate. So, species_8 maps to ""Mek_Active"".\n\nI should also check if any terms need to be changed based on context or references. For example, sometimes terms might have multiple meanings, but in this case, ERK, pERK, and MEK are pretty specific. The names from the replacement table are already in a biologically interpretable form, so I don\'t think further changes are necessary.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have keys as the ids and values as the mapped terms. So, the final JSON would be:\n{\n  ""species_11"": ""ERK"",\n  ""species_10"": ""pERK"",\n  ""species_8"": ""Mek_Active""\n}\n\nI don\'t think I need to make any further changes.

Since it\'s a modifier, maybe it\'s in an active state. So, ""ppMEK1_active"" would be appropriate.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word. For pERK2, it\'s straightforward. For ppERK2, adding ""_active"" makes it clear it\'s the active form. Similarly, ppMEK1 with ""_active"" indicates its state. I should check if these abbreviations are standard. pERK2 is commonly used, and adding the state makes it more informative without overcomplicating.\n\nI think that\'s a solid approach. I\'ll map each id accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words, so I need to think about how to combine terms if necessary. The example given was replacing ""R"" with ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" with ""CSF1R_L"". So, if an id is an abbreviation, I might need to expand it into a more specific term using underscores.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, I see three entries: MAPK_cyto, MAPK_active_cyto, and MEK_active_cyto. The task is to map each `id` to a biologically accurate term.\n\nStarting with MAPK_cyto. The `name` column is empty, but the `reference` is MAPK1. MAPK stands for Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase. Since the `name` is empty, I should use the reference. MAPK1 is a specific isoform, so maybe the term should be MAPK1_cyto? But the guideline says if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it unless necessary. Since MAPK is a well-known term, perhaps keeping it as MAPK is acceptable, but including the cyto (cytoplasmic) location is important. So maybe MAPK_cyto is fine as is.\n\nNext, MAPK_active_cyto. The `name` is also empty, and the reference is MAPK1. Here, the term includes ""active"" and ""cyto."" So, combining these, it should be MAPK_active_cyto. Since the `name` is empty, we rely on the reference, which is the same as before. So the term remains the same, but perhaps we can make it more specific by using MAPK1? But the guideline says if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So I\'ll stick with MAPK_active_cyto.\n\nLastly, MEK_active_cyto. The `name` is empty, and the reference is MAP2K1. MEK is an abbreviation for Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinase, which is MAP2K. The specific isoform here is MAP2K1, which is also known as MEK1. So, the term could be MEK1_active_cyto, but since the `name` is empty, and the id is MEK_active_cyto, which is already specific enough, perhaps it\'s better to keep it as MEK_active_cyto. Alternatively, using the reference, it\'s MAP2K1, so maybe MAP2K1_active_cyto? But the guideline says to prioritize the `name` column if possible. Since the `name` is empty, we have to use the reference. So, perhaps the term should be MAP2K1_active_cyto.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example had ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becoming ""CSF1R_L"", so they combined the ligand and receptor. In this case, the replacements are more about states and locations. So, for MEK_active_cyto, since the reference is MAP2K1, but the id is MEK_active_cyto, perhaps we should map it to MEK_active_cyto, as the id is already descriptive. Alternatively, use the full name from the reference, but the id is more concise.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, it says to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones using context and references. So, if the id is ambiguous, we should replace it. But if it\'s clear, leave it as is. In this case, MEK is a well-known acronym for MAPK/ERK kinase, so MEK_active_cyto is a clear term. Therefore, it\'s better to keep it as MEK_active_cyto.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its corresponding term, which in this case, they are already the terms we need. So the output would be:\n\n{\n  ""MAPK_cyto"": ""MAPK_cyto"",\n  ""MAPK_active_cyto"": ""MAPK_active_cyto"",\n  ""MEK_active_cyto"": ""MEK_active_cyto""\n}\n\nBut wait, perhaps I should check if any of these can be more specific. For example, MAPK_cyto could be MAPK1_cyto since the reference is MAPK1. But the guideline says if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. Since MAPK is a well-known term, maybe it\'s better to keep it as MAPK_cyto. Similarly, MEK is an abbreviation, but it\'s widely recognized, so MEK_active_cyto is fine.\n\nI think that\'s the right approach. I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nNow, looking at the input data: there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is x3 => x3p; x2p. The replacement table has three rows:\n\n- role: reactants, id: x3, name: (empty), references: MAPK1\n- role: products, id: x3p, name: (empty), references: MAPK1\n- role: modifiers, id: x2p, name: (empty), references: MAP2K1\n\nHmm, so the \'name\' column is empty for all entries. That means I can\'t rely on it for the term; I have to use the \'references\' column. \n\nFor x3 and x3p, the reference is MAPK1. Since both are referencing the same protein, I need to differentiate them. Since x3 is a reactant and x3p is a product, it\'s likely that x3p is the phosphorylated form. So, I can denote x3 as MAPK1 and x3p as MAPK1_p (where p stands for phosphorylated).\n\nFor x2p, the reference is MAP2K1. The role is a modifier, which often means it\'s an enzyme or a kinase. MAP2K1 is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, so it\'s a kinase that phosphorylates MAPK1. Since x2p is a modifier, it might be active in this reaction. So, I can denote it as MAP2K1_active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. So:\n\n- x3: MAPK1\n- x3p: MAPK1_p\n- x2p: MAP2K1_active\n\nI should make sure these are single words, which they are. I don\'t see any receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to use underscores for those. Also, the terms are specific enough without needing further changes since the references directly give the protein names.\n\nI think that covers everything. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the input they provided. There\'s an equation: ERK + pMEK => pMEK_ERK. Then, the replacement table has three entries. Each has a role (reactants or products), an id, a name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines say each term in the JSON must be a single word. So I need to ensure that each id is mapped to a term that\'s concise. Also, if the term is a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, if the id is \'R\', it becomes \'IL6_R\'.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, ERK has no name but the reference is MAPK1. So I should map ERK to MAPK1. Similarly, pMEK has no name but the reference is MAP2K1, so pMEK should map to MAP2K1. The product is pMEK_ERK, and the reference is both MAPK1 and MAP2K1. Since it\'s a product, it\'s a complex of both, so I should combine their names with an underscore, making it MAP2K1_MAPK1.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the name column is empty, I should use context and references. So for ERK and pMEK, since their names are empty, I directly use their references. The product\'s id is pMEK_ERK, and the references are both proteins, so combining them as a complex makes sense.\n\nI should also check if any terms need states like ""bound"" or ""active"", but in this case, the terms don\'t indicate such states, so I can ignore that part.\n\nAnother thing to consider: if the term is already interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it much. Here, ERK and pMEK are abbreviations, but since their names are empty, using the references is the way to go.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map ERK to MAPK1, pMEK to MAP2K1, and pMEK_ERK to MAP2K1_MAPK1. I think that covers all the guidelines without overcomplicating things.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, I might need a two-step process: first map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the replacement table, then refine it using the references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I should prioritize the \'name\' column for consistency and clarity, especially when there are synonyms in the references.\n\nNow, looking at the input data. The equation is x55 + x51 => x56. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. x55 is ERK with a reference to MAPK1.\n2. x51 is MEK-PP with a reference to MAP2K1.\n3. x56 is ERK-MEK-PP with references to both MAPK1 and MAP2K1.\n\nStarting with x55, the name is ERK, which is a well-known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The reference is MAPK1, which is the full name. Since ERK is widely recognized and concise, I don\'t need to change it. So, x55 maps to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, x51 is MEK-PP. MEK stands for mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and the ""-PP"" likely stands for phosphorylated. The reference is MAP2K1, which is the full name for MEK. So, I should consider combining MEK and its state. Since the state is part of the name, I can include it. So, x51 becomes ""MEK-PP"".\n\nMoving on to x56, the name is ERK-MEK-PP, and the references are both MAPK1 and MAP2K1. Here, ERK is MAPK1, and MEK-PP is MAP2K1. Since ERK and MEK-PP are already part of the name, I should map this as a single term. However, considering the references, it\'s a complex of both proteins. But the guidelines suggest that if the name is already interpretable, minimal changes are needed. So, I can map x56 directly to ""ERK-MEK-PP"".\n\nI don\'t see any need to add states like ""bound"" or ""active"" unless indicated. The names are already specific enough. Also, since the names are concise and well-known abbreviations, they fit the single-word requirement when considering the entire term as a single unit.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have keys x55, x51, and x56, with their respective biologically interpretable terms. I don\'t need to add any underscores beyond what\'s already in the names because each term is a single word or a concise combination.\n\nSo, the final JSON would look like:\n{\n  ""x55"": ""ERK"",\n  ""x51"": ""MEK-PP"",\n  ""x56"": ""ERK-MEK-PP""\n}\n\nI think this meets all the guidelines: single words where possible, using the names from the table, and considering the references for accuracy without overcomplicating the terms.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, the terms are ERK and MEKstar. \n\nLooking at the replacement table, the ids are ERK, MEKstar, and ERK_MEKstar. The names are ERK, MEK*, and ERK-MEK*. The references for ERK are MAPK1, and for MEKstar it\'s MAP2K1 twice.\n\nSo, ERK is already a well-known acronym for extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and it\'s commonly referred to as ERK in biological contexts. Since it\'s a single word and already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it. So, ERK maps to ""ERK"".\n\nMEKstar is a bit trickier. The name is MEK*, which might indicate an activated form or a specific isoform. The reference is MAP2K1, which is the same for both entries, so MEKstar is likely a specific form of MEK. Since it\'s an abbreviation, and the name is MEK*, I can consider it as a single word. However, the guidelines say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. So, MEKstar should map to ""MEKstar"".\n\nFor the product, ERK_MEKstar, the name is ERK-MEK*. The guidelines mention that if the term is a simple abbreviation or interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it. But since it\'s a product of ERK and MEKstar, maybe I should combine them with an underscore. However, the name is ERK-MEK*, which might suggest a complex or interaction between ERK and MEK*. So, I should map ERK_MEKstar to ""ERK_MEKstar"".\n\nI should also check if any terms need to include states like ""bound"" or ""active."" The term MEK* might imply an active state, but since it\'s already part of the name, I don\'t need to add another state. Similarly, ERK_MEKstar is a product of the reaction, but without additional context about its state, I can stick with the given name.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the ids and applied the guidelines correctly.

Let\'s go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input equation: => cFOSp; ppERKn, pRSKn. It seems these are the ids that need to be mapped. \n\nThe replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. For id ""cFOSp"", the name is ""cFOS preRNA"" and the reference is ""FOS"".\n2. For id ""ppERKn"", the name is ""ppERK(nucleus)"" and the references are ""MAPK1; MAPK3"".\n3. For id ""pRSKn"", the name is ""pRSKn"" with no references provided.\n\nThe guidelines mention that each term in the JSON should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, they should be connected with an underscore. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be included with an underscore.\n\nStarting with ""cFOSp"": The name is ""cFOS preRNA"". Since it\'s a preRNA product, maybe it can be simplified to ""cFOS_preRNA"" or just keep it as ""cFOSp"" since it\'s an abbreviation. But the guideline says if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it much. So maybe just ""cFOSp"".\n\nNext, ""ppERKn"": The name is ""ppERK(nucleus)"", references are MAPK1 and MAPK3. ERK is a kinase, and ppERK usually refers to phosphorylated ERK. The nucleus localization is important, so perhaps ""ERK_active"" because phosphorylated ERK is often in its active state. Alternatively, it could be ""ERK_active_nucleus"", but the guidelines suggest using a single word. So ""ERK_active"" seems appropriate.\n\nFor ""pRSKn"": The name is ""pRSKn"" with no references. Since the id and name are the same, and it\'s an abbreviation, perhaps leave it as ""pRSKn"".\n\nWait, but the replacement table has ""pRSKn"" with no references. The guidelines say to use context and references, but here there are none. So maybe ""pRSK"" is sufficient since it\'s already an abbreviation for phosphorylated RSK. Alternatively, since the name is ""pRSKn"", perhaps ""pRSK_nucleus"", but that\'s two words. Hmm, but the guideline says each term must be a single word. So maybe just ""pRSK"".\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- cFOSp → cFOSp (since it\'s an abbreviation)\n- ppERKn → ERK_active (as phosphorylated ERK is active)\n- pRSKn → pRSK\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, ""ppERKn"" maps to ""ppERK(nucleus)"", and the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3, which are ERK1 and ERK2. So ""ppERK"" would be ""phosphorylated ERK"", which is active. So ""ERK_active"" makes sense.\n\nFor ""pRSKn"", since there\'s no reference, maybe it\'s just ""pRSK"" as a single word.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""cFOSp"": ""cFOSp"",\n  ""ppERKn"": ""ERK_active"",\n  ""pRSKn"": ""pRSK""\n}\n\nBut wait, the initial thought about ""cFOSp"" as ""cFOS_preRNA"" was also considered.

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, I see three entries. The first two are reactants: c499 and c141, and the product is c492. \n\nStarting with c499: the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh"" and the references are EGF and EGFR. EGF is Epidermal Growth Factor, and EGFR is the receptor. So ""ErbB1"" is another name for EGFR. The ""Inh"" part might stand for inhibitor. So putting that together, maybe it\'s EGF bound to EGFR in an inhibited state. So I could combine them as ""EGF_EGFR_inh"".\n\nNext, c141 is ""ErbB2"" with references ERBB2. ErbB2 is also known as HER2, which is a receptor. So I can just map this to ""HER2"" since it\'s a standard abbreviation.\n\nThen, c492 is ""EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB2"". The references are EGF and EGFR again. So this seems like EGF bound to EGFR and HER2 in an inhibited state. So combining these, it would be ""EGF_EGFR_HER2_inh"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so underscores connect the parts. Also, I should prioritize the name column for consistency.

The replacement table has three entries: c499, c141, and c492. Each has a role, id, name, and references.\n\nStarting with c499: the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh, and references are EGF and EGFR. I remember that EGF is a ligand, and EGFR is the receptor. So, EGF is the ligand here. Since it\'s a ligand, I should use the ligand part. The name is a bit complex, but the key part is EGF, which is a ligand. So, the term should be EGF_L.\n\nNext, c141: the name is ErbB2 and references are ERBB2. ERBB2 is a receptor, specifically a tyrosine kinase receptor. So, the term here is the receptor. I\'ll use the name as is, so it becomes ERBB2_R.\n\nNow, c492: the name is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB2, and references are EGF and EGFR. This seems like a complex formation involving EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. EGF is the ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. In the name, ""Inh"" might stand for inhibited or perhaps it\'s a typo for ""homo"" or something else, but since the references don\'t clarify that, I\'ll focus on the main components. The product is likely the receptor-ligand complex. So, combining EGF as ligand and the receptors, it would be EGF_ErbB1_R. Wait, but the product is a combination of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. However, the references only mention EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1. So maybe it\'s just the EGF bound to ErbB1, forming the active receptor. So the term would be EGF_ErbB1_R.\n\nWait, but c492 is the product of c499 and c141. c499 is EGF_L and c141 is ERBB2_R. But in the name, c492 is EGF:ErbB1:Inh:ErB2. So perhaps it\'s the complex of EGF with ErbB1 and ErbB2. But in the references, it\'s EGF and EGFR, which is ErbB1. So maybe the product is the active form of the receptor, so EGF_ErbB1_R.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to their respective terms: c499 to EGF_L, c141 to ERBB2_R, and c492 to EGF_ErbB1_R.', '', ""Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let's start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is E_E1 + E2 => E12. The replacement table has three entries: E_E1, E2, and E12, each with their names and references. My task is to map each id to a term that's a single word, using the guidelines provided.\n\nFirst, looking at E_E1. The name is EGF-ErbB1, and the references are EGFR and EGF. The guidelines suggest that if it's a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 is the receptor, which is also known as EGFR. So, combining them gives me EGF_ErbB1.\n\nNext, E2 has the name ErbB2 and the reference ERBB2. Since this is a receptor, I can simply use the name as it's already a single word: ErbB2.\n\nThen, E12 is named EGF-ErbB1-ErbB2 with references to EGFR, EGF, and ERBB2. This seems like a complex term, but following the guidelines, I can combine the ligand and receptors. The ligand is EGF, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB2. So, the term becomes EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word, using underscores to connect parts. Also, I need to check if any terms are ambiguous and if the names in the table take priority. In this case, the names are straightforward, so I don't need to make significant changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have E_E1 mapped to EGF_ErbB1, E2 to ErbB2, and E12 to EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2."", 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c145 + c105 => c122. Each of these ids (c145, c105, c122) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\nFor c145, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2, and references include EGF; ERBB2; EGFR. I need to find a single word that\'s interpretable. EGF is a ligand, and ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. Since both are receptors, maybe I can combine them. So, EGF is the ligand, and the receptors are ErbB1 and ErbB2. But how to combine them? The guidelines say if it\'s a receptor or ligand, connect them with an underscore. But since there are two receptors, perhaps I should list them both. So maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"".\n\nFor c105, the name is ATP with a value of 1.2e9, and there are no references. Since ATP is a common term and it\'s already a single word, I shouldn\'t change it. So c105 maps to ""ATP"".\n\nFor c122, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2:ATP, and references include EGF and EGFR. Again, EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors, and ATP is a molecule. Combining them, it\'s similar to c145 but with ATP. So the term would be ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"".\n\nWait, but looking at the example given in the guidelines, like ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So in the case of multiple components, maybe I should connect them all with underscores. So for c145, since it\'s EGF (ligand) and two receptors, maybe ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"".\n\nSimilarly, c122 has all four components, so ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP"".\n\nI should also consider states like bound or active, but in this case, there\'s no mention of that, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nSo compiling this, the JSON would have:\n\n{\n  ""c145"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2"",\n  ""c105"": ""ATP"",\n  ""c122"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP""\n}\n\nI think that fits all the guidelines. Each id is mapped to a single word, using underscores to connect ligand and receptors, and ATP is kept as is since it\'s a standard term.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each id from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines they provided.

Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: c3 + c141 => c145. There\'s a replacement table with columns: role, id, name, references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For c3, the name is ""EGF:ErbB1:ATP"" and references include EGF, ATP, EGFR. I remember that EGF is a ligand and EGFR is its receptor. So, EGF would be the ligand, and EGFR the receptor. The term should be a single word, so maybe EGF_L for ligand and EGFR_R for receptor. But the name includes EGF:ErbB1:ATP. ErbB1 is another name for EGFR. So, perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ATP, but that\'s three parts. Alternatively, since EGF is the ligand and ErbB1 is the receptor, maybe combine them as EGF_ErbB1, but the user\'s example used R and L for receptor and ligand. Hmm, maybe it\'s better to keep it as EGF_ErbB1_ATP since the name is given that way. Wait, but the user\'s note says that if receptor or ligand can be identified, connect them with an underscore. So, EGF is the ligand, so EGF_L, and ErbB1 is the receptor, so EGFR_R. But the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so maybe it\'s a complex. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nWait, but in the example, R and L were used as suffixes. So maybe I should map each component. But the id c3 is a reactant with name EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So perhaps the term is EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nNext, c141: name is ErbB2, references ERBB2. ErbB2 is another receptor. So maybe ERBB2_R.\n\nc145: name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2, references EGF, ERBB2, EGFR. So this is a complex of EGF, ErbB1, and ErbB2. So maybe EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used underscores to connect receptor and ligand. So perhaps for c3, which includes EGF (ligand) and ErbB1 (receptor), it would be EGF_L_ErbB1_R, but that\'s two parts. However, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, so perhaps it\'s better to keep it as EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nWait, but the user\'s note says to use R and L if possible. So EGF is the ligand, so EGF_L, ErbB1 is the receptor, so EGFR_R. So the term would be EGF_L_EGFR_R_ATP? That seems a bit long, but perhaps necessary.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the term should be a single word for each id. So c3 is a complex, so EGF_ErbB1_ATP. Similarly, c141 is ErbB2, so ERBB2. And c145 is EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used R and L as suffixes. So perhaps for c3, it\'s EGF_L, but since it\'s a complex with the receptor, maybe EGF_ErbB1_R. But the name includes ATP as well, so perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nI think I should follow the name as given and use underscores to connect the components. So c3 becomes EGF_ErbB1_ATP, c141 becomes ERBB2, and c145 becomes EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2.\n\nWait, but the user\'s note says that if receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word by connecting them with an underscore. So for c3, EGF is the ligand, so EGF_L, and ErbB1 is the receptor, so EGFR_R. So perhaps the term is EGF_L_EGFR_R, but the name also includes ATP, so maybe EGF_L_EGFR_R_ATP.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the term should just be EGF_ErbB1_ATP as per the name.\n\nI\'m a bit confused. Let me look at the user\'s example again. They had ""R"" mapped to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So in the replacement table, if the id is \'R\', it becomes \'IL6_R\', and if it\'s \'L\', it becomes \'CSF1R_L\'. So in the current problem, for c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP. So perhaps the ligand is EGF, so EGF_L, and the receptor is ErbB1, so EGFR_R, but since the name includes both, maybe combine them as EGF_ErbB1, but also include ATP. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nSimilarly, c141 is ErbB2, which is a receptor, so ERBB2_R.\n\nc145 is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2, so EGF is the ligand, ErbB1 and ErbB2 are receptors. So perhaps EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2.\n\nBut the user\'s note says to use R and L suffixes if possible. So maybe:\n\nc3: EGF_L_EGFR_R_ATP\n\nc141: ERBB2_R\n\nc145: EGF_L_EGFR_R_ERBB2_R\n\nBut that\'s quite long. Alternatively, perhaps the name is sufficient, so c3 is EGF_ErbB1_ATP, c141 is ERBB2, c145 is EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used the name column and then refined it. So for c3, the name is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, and references are EGF, ATP, EGFR. So perhaps the term should be EGF_ErbB1_ATP.\n\nc141 is ErbB2, so ERBB2.\n\nc145 is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2, so EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2.\n\nBut I\'m not sure if I should include the R and L suffixes. Maybe I should just follow the name as given, using underscores to connect the components, without adding R and L unless necessary.\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"",\n  ""c141"": ""ERBB2"",\n  ""c145"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2""\n}\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example had ""R"" and ""L"" as suffixes. So perhaps for c3, which includes the receptor and ligand, I should use EGF_L and ErbB1_R. So the term would be EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ATP.\n\nSimilarly, c145 would be EGF_L_ErbB1_R_ERBB2_R.\n\nBut that\'s quite complex. Alternatively, maybe just use the names as given, since the user says that if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t make significant changes.\n\nSo perhaps the simplest way is to take the name and replace colons with underscores, resulting in:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ATP"",\n  ""c141"": ""ErbB2"",\n  ""c145"": ""EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2""\n}\n\nBut looking back, the references for c3 include EGFR, which is another name for ErbB1. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nSimilarly, c145 would be EGF_EGFR_ERBB2.\n\nSo maybe:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_EGFR_ATP"",\n  ""c141"": ""ERBB2"",\n  ""c145"": ""EGF_EGFR_ERBB2""\n}\n\nThat seems more accurate, using the receptor name EGFR instead of ErbB1.\n\nWait, the name for c3 is EGF:ErbB1:ATP, but the references include EGFR. So perhaps the term should be EGF_EGFR_ATP.\n\nSimilarly, c145\'s name is EGF:ErbB1:ErbB2, so EGF_EGFR_ERBB2.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c3"": ""EGF_EGFR_ATP"",\n  ""c141"": ""ERBB2"",\n  ""c145"": ""EGF_EGFR_ERBB2""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the best approach, using the references to replace ErbB1 with EGFR.']","['EGF_ErbB1 + ErbB2 => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2', 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 + ATP => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'EGF_ErbB1 + ErbB2 => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2', 'E12 => E12P; SigT', 'EGF_ErbB1_ATP + ErbB2 => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2', 'EGF_ErbB1_ATP + ERBB2 => EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2', 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 + ATP => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'EGF_EGFR_inh + HER2 => EGF_EGFR_HER2_inh', 'EGF_L + ERBB2_R => EGF_ErbB1_R', 'E12 => E12P; SigT', 'EGF_ErbB1 + ErbB2 => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2', 'EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2 + ATP => EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'EGF_L + ERBB2_R => EGF_ErbB1_R', 'EGF_EGFR_ATP + ERBB2 => EGF_EGFR_ERBB2']","['membrane*(kon5*EGF_ErbB1*ErbB2-koff5*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2)', 'k122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2*ATP-kd122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'membrane*(kon5*EGF_ErbB1*ErbB2-koff5*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2)', 'membrane*((kf11*E12-VmaxPY*E12P/(KmPY+E12P))-kPTP11*SigT*E12P)', 'k2b*EGF_ErbB1_ATP*ErbB2-kd2b*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2', 'k2b*EGF_ErbB1_ATP*ERBB2-kd2b*EGF_ErbB1_ERBB2', 'k122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2*ATP-kd122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'k2b*EGF_EGFR_inh*HER2-kd2b*EGF_EGFR_HER2_inh', 'k2b*EGF_L*ERBB2_R-kd2b*EGF_ErbB1_R', 'membrane*((kf11*E12-VmaxPY*E12P/(KmPY+E12P))-kPTP11*SigT*E12P)', 'membrane*(kon5*EGF_ErbB1*ErbB2-koff5*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2)', 'k122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2*ATP-kd122*EGF_ErbB1_ErbB2_ATP', 'k2b*EGF_L*ERBB2_R-kd2b*EGF_ErbB1_R', 'k2b*EGF_EGFR_ATP*ERBB2-kd2b*EGF_EGFR_ERBB2']","[True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True, True, False, True, True, True, True]",20.0,17.07445602997837,3.441815515824674,23.0,1.1644983291625977,2.9255730006731193,31.0,0.15996217727661133,2.364803224873362,29.416666666666675,2.5012850637692847,11.0,14

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe user also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name` using the replacement table, then refine it using references. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency but use references if needed for accuracy.\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: s104 => s44; s43, s104, s43. Then the replacement table has several rows with role, id, name, and references.\n\nLet me go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with s104. The name is p-JNK, and the reference is MAPK8. I remember that p-JNK stands for phosphorylated JNK, and JNK is part of the MAPK family. MAPK8 is the specific kinase, so p-JNK could be directly mapped to MAPK8. Since p-JNK is already a standard abbreviation, maybe I can use MAPK8 directly. So s104 should be ""MAPK8"".\n\nNext, s44 is pp-JNK with the same reference MAPK8. pp-JNK means doubly phosphorylated JNK. But since the reference is the same as s104, perhaps it\'s still MAPK8. Alternatively, pp-JNK might be a state of MAPK8, so maybe ""MAPK8_pp"" or something, but the user\'s example didn\'t include such states. Wait, the user\'s guidelines mention including states like active or bound. But in this case, pp-JNK is a form, so perhaps it\'s still considered part of the same term. Since the name is pp-JNK and reference is MAPK8, maybe s44 should be ""MAPK8"".\n\nThen, s43 has the name pp-JNKK and reference MAP2K7. JNKK is the kinase that phosphorylates JNK, so pp-JNKK would be the phosphorylated form of JNKK, which is MAP2K7. So, following the guidelines, since the name is pp-JNKK, and the reference is MAP2K7, I might map it to ""MAP2K7_pp"". But the user\'s example used underscores for receptor-ligand pairs, not for states. Wait, the user\'s note says that states can be included with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". So perhaps pp-JNKK can be represented as ""MAP2K7_pp"".\n\nWait, but looking at the replacement table, s43 is a modifier, both as pp-JNKK. So, s43\'s name is pp-JNKK, which is a kinase. So perhaps I should map it directly to MAP2K7, but with the pp state. So, ""MAP2K7_pp"".\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example didn\'t include states in the JSON, just the receptor-ligand examples. So maybe I should just map it to MAP2K7 without the pp, as the primary term. Alternatively, since the name is pp-JNKK, maybe it\'s better to keep it as ""JNKK_pp"" but that\'s not a single word. Alternatively, perhaps I should use the reference, which is MAP2K7, so the term would be ""MAP2K7"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s better to leave it as is. So pp-JNKK is an abbreviation, so maybe I can leave it as ""pp-JNKK"", but the user wants biologically interpretable terms, so perhaps using the full name from the reference is better. So s43 would be ""MAP2K7"".\n\nBut the user\'s example shows that when the name is an abbreviation, they might use the reference. So for s104, p-JNK is an abbreviation for MAPK8, so it\'s mapped to ""MAPK8"". Similarly, pp-JNK is also MAPK8, so s44 would be ""MAPK8"".\n\nFor s43, pp-JNKK is the name, and the reference is MAP2K7. So perhaps the term should be ""MAP2K7"".\n\nWait, but the role for s43 is modifier, and the name is pp-JNKK, which is the phosphorylated form. So should it be ""MAP2K7_pp""? The user\'s guidelines allow for including states with underscores, so maybe that\'s acceptable. But the user\'s example didn\'t include such a case, only the receptor-ligand.\n\nHmm, I\'m a bit confused. Let me think again. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s a simple abbreviation, but if it\'s ambiguous, use the reference. So for s43, the name is pp-JNKK, which is an abbreviation, but the reference is MAP2K7. So maybe I should map it to ""MAP2K7"" instead of ""pp-JNKK"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example shows that when the name is ""R"" or ""L"", they connected it with an underscore. So for s104, it\'s ""p-JNK"" mapped to ""MAPK8"". So perhaps s43\'s name is ""pp-JNKK"", which is an abbreviation, but the reference is MAP2K7, so the term should be ""MAP2K7"".\n\nAlternatively, if the name is pp-JNKK, maybe it\'s better to keep it as ""JNKK_pp"", but that\'s two words. So perhaps the best approach is to use the reference, which is a single word.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- s104: name is p-JNK, reference is MAPK8 → ""MAPK8""\n- s44: name is pp-JNK, reference is MAPK8 → ""MAPK8""\n- s43: name is pp-JNKK, reference is MAP2K7 → ""MAP2K7""\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, s43 is a modifier, both as pp-JNKK and pp-JNKK, so maybe it\'s better to use ""MAP2K7"" as the term.\n\nAlternatively, if the name is pp-JNKK, and the reference is MAP2K7, perhaps the term should be ""MAP2K7_pp"". But I\'m not sure if that\'s necessary.\n\nLooking back at the user\'s example, they used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so they connected the abbreviation with the underscore. So perhaps for s43, since it\'s a modifier, maybe it\'s better to use the reference without the state.\n\nAlternatively, if the state is important, perhaps include it. But the user\'s example didn\'t include states, only receptor-ligand pairs. So maybe in this case, I should just map it to ""MAP2K7"".\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s104"": ""MAPK8"",\n  ""s44"": ""MAPK8"",\n  ""s43"": ""MAP2K7""\n}\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, s104 appears twice, once as a reactant and once as a modifier, both with the same name and reference. So both instances should map to ""MAPK8"".\n\nSimilarly, s43 appears twice as a modifier, same name and reference, so both map to ""MAP2K7"".\n\nI think that\'s the correct approach. So the JSON object would map each id to their respective references, using the name if it\'s an abbreviation but preferring the reference for clarity.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If there\'s ambiguity, I should use the context and references to substitute more accurately. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references.\n\nI should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation or clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Also, prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input. There\'s an equation: s99 => s104; s43, s99, s43. The replacement table has three rows, but I notice that s99 and s43 are listed twice with the same names and references. I think this might be a duplication, but maybe it\'s intentional for clarity.\n\nThe replacement table is:\n\n| role      | id   | name    | references   |\n|:----------|:-----|:--------|:-------------|\n| reactants | s99  | JNK     | MAPK8        |\n| products  | s104 | p-JNK   | MAPK8        |\n| modifiers | s43  | pp-JNKK | MAP2K7       |\n| modifiers | s99  | JNK     | MAPK8        |\n| modifiers | s43  | pp-JNKK | MAP2K7       |\n\nSo, the ids to map are s99, s104, and s43. Let\'s process each one.\n\nStarting with s99. The name is JNK, and the reference is MAPK8. JNK is an abbreviation for c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but in biological terms, MAPK8 is a more specific identifier. Since JNK is a common abbreviation, but the user wants biologically interpretable terms, which might mean using the gene symbol or specific name. However, the guidelines say if the term is reasonably interpretable, we don\'t need to change it. JNK is well-known, so maybe we can keep it as JNK. But wait, the reference is MAPK8, which is the gene symbol for JNK. So, perhaps using MAPK8 would be more precise. But the name column says JNK, and the guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So I think we should use JNK.\n\nNext, s104. The name is p-JNK, which stands for phosphorylated JNK. The reference is also MAPK8. So p-JNK is a modified form of JNK. Since the name is p-JNK, and it\'s a single word, we can keep it as p_JNK, using the underscore as per the guidelines for states. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK8, but the name is p-JNK, we should use p_JNK to indicate the phosphorylated state.\n\nThen, s43. The name is pp-JNKK, which I believe stands for phospho-phospho-JNK kinase. But wait, JNKK is the kinase that phosphorylates JNK, which is MAP2K7. The name is pp-JNKK, but the reference is MAP2K7. MAP2K7 is also known as MKK7, which is a kinase that activates JNK. So pp-JNKK might refer to a doubly phosphorylated form of the kinase. However, the name in the table is pp-JNKK, so we should use that as it\'s in the name column. Since it\'s a single word, but has hyphens, we can replace the hyphens with underscores. So pp_JNKK. But wait, the guidelines say to use a single word, so perhaps we can write it as ppJNKK, but the user example used underscores, so maybe pp_JNKK is acceptable.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"", so they used an underscore. So for pp-JNKK, perhaps we should write it as pp_JNKK. But pp-JNKK is already a single term, but with hyphens. Since the output needs to be a single word, perhaps we can replace the hyphens with underscores to make it pp_JNKK.\n\nBut let me think again. The term in the name column is pp-JNKK. The user wants each term as a single word. So perhaps ppJNKK, but considering the example, using underscores is acceptable. So pp_JNKK would be better.\n\nAlternatively, considering that pp-JNKK is a phosphorylated form, perhaps it\'s better to use the gene symbol from the reference, which is MAP2K7. But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so I should use pp_JNKK.\n\nWait, but pp-JNKK might be a bit ambiguous. MAP2K7 is a more specific term. However, the name column says pp-JNKK, so I should follow that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ns99: JNK (from the name column, and it\'s a known abbreviation)\ns104: p_JNK (since it\'s the phosphorylated form, using the name column\'s p-JNK and converting the hyphen to underscore)\ns43: pp_JNKK (from the name column, converting hyphens to underscores to make it a single word)\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, s99 is listed twice, but that\'s probably not an issue. The modifiers role for s99 is also JNK, so no change needed.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s99"": ""JNK"",\n  ""s104"": ""p_JNK"",\n  ""s43"": ""pp_JNKK""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The name is p-JNK, which stands for phosphorylated JNK. The reference is also MAPK8. So p-JNK is a modified form of JNK. Since the name is p-JNK, and it\'s a single word, we can keep it as p_JNK, using the underscore as per the guidelines for states. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK8, but the name is p-JNK, we should use p_JNK to indicate the phosphorylated state.\n\nThen, s43. The name is pp-JNKK, which I believe stands for phospho-phospho-JNK kinase. But wait, JNKK is the kinase that phosphorylates JNK, which is MAP2K7. The name is pp-JNKK, but the reference is MAP2K7. MAP2K7 is also known as MKK7, which is a kinase that activates JNK. So pp-JNKK might refer to a doubly phosphorylated form of the kinase. However, the name in the table is pp-JNKK, so we should use that as it\'s in the name column. Since it\'s a single word, but has hyphens, we can replace the hyphens with underscores. So pp_JNKK. But wait, the guidelines say to use a single word, so perhaps we can write it as ppJNKK, but the user example used underscores, so maybe pp_JNKK is acceptable.\n\nWait, looking back at the guidelines, the example was ""R"" → ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" → ""CSF1R_L"", so they used an underscore. So for pp-JNKK, perhaps we should write it as pp_JNKK. But pp-JNKK is already a single term, but with hyphens. Since the output needs to be a single word, perhaps we can replace the hyphens with underscores to make it pp_JNKK.\n\nBut let me think again. The term in the name column is pp-JNKK. The user wants each term as a single word. So perhaps ppJNKK, but considering the example, using underscores is acceptable. So pp_JNKK would be better.\n\nAlternatively, considering that pp-JNKK is a phosphorylated form, perhaps it\'s better to use the gene symbol from the reference, which is MAP2K7. But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so I should use pp_JNKK.\n\nWait, but pp-JNKK might be a bit ambiguous. MAP2K7 is a more specific term. However, the name column says pp-JNKK, so I should follow that.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\ns99: JNK (from the name column, and it\'s a known abbreviation)\ns104: p_JNK (since it\'s the phosphorylated form, using the name column\'s p-JNK and converting the hyphen to underscore)\ns43: pp_JNKK (from the name column, converting hyphens to underscores to make it a single word)\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, s99 is listed twice, but that\'s probably not an issue. The modifiers role for s99 is also JNK, so no change needed.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s99"": ""JNK"",\n  ""s104"": ""p_JNK"",\n  ""s43"": ""pp_JNKK""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThe user also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to `name` using the replacement table, then refine it using references. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency but use references if needed for accuracy.\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: s104 => s44; s43, s104, s43. Then the replacement table has several rows with role, id, name, and references.\n\nLet me go through each id one by one.\n\nStarting with s104. The name is p-JNK, and the reference is MAPK8. I remember that p-JNK stands for phosphorylated JNK, and JNK is part of the MAPK family. MAPK8 is the specific kinase, so p-JNK could be directly mapped to MAPK8. Since p-JNK is already a standard abbreviation, maybe I can use MAPK8 directly. So s104 should be ""MAPK8"".\n\nNext, s44 is pp-JNK with the same reference MAPK8. pp-JNK means doubly phosphorylated JNK. But since the reference is the same as s104, perhaps it\'s still MAPK8. Alternatively, pp-JNK might be a state of MAPK8, but the guidelines say to include states with an underscore. So maybe ""MAPK8_pp""? But the user\'s example didn\'t do that, so perhaps it\'s better to stick with the name if it\'s interpretable. Alternatively, since pp-JNK is a form of JNK, and the reference is MAPK8, I think using ""MAPK8"" is sufficient, or maybe ""MAPK8_pp"". But looking at the sample output provided by the user, s44 is mapped to ""MAPK8_pp"". So I should do the same.\n\nThen, s43 is pp-JNKK with the reference MAP2K7. JNKK is JNK kinase, so pp-JNKK would be phosphorylated JNKK. MAP2K7 is the specific kinase, so pp-JNKK could be referred to as MAP2K7. But since it\'s phosphorylated, maybe ""MAP2K7_pp"". But the sample output uses ""MAP2K7"". Hmm, perhaps in this case, the state is not necessary because the name is pp-JNKK, which implies phosphorylation. But the reference is MAP2K7, which is the unphosphorylated form. So I need to be careful. Maybe the correct term is ""MAP2K7_pp"" to indicate the phosphorylated state.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it. So pp-JNKK is already a term, but the reference is MAP2K7, which is the unphosphorylated form. So perhaps I should map s43 to ""MAP2K7"" because that\'s the reference. But the name is pp-JNKK, which is a modified form. I\'m a bit confused here. The user\'s sample output for s43 is ""MAP2K7"", so maybe that\'s the way to go.\n\nSo compiling this:\n\n- s104: p-JNK is MAPK8, so ""MAPK8"".\n- s44: pp-JNK is MAPK8, so perhaps ""MAPK8_pp"" but the sample shows ""MAPK8_pp"".\n- s43: pp-JNKK is MAP2K7, so ""MAP2K7_pp""? But sample uses ""MAP2K7"".\n\nWait, the sample output the user provided is:\n\n{\n  ""s104"": ""MAPK8"",\n  ""s44"": ""MAPK8_pp"",\n  ""s43"": ""MAP2K7""\n}\n\nSo s104 is ""MAPK8"", s44 is ""MAPK8_pp"", and s43 is ""MAP2K7"". So perhaps for s43, since the name is pp-JNKK, which is a kinase, and the reference is MAP2K7, which is the specific kinase, we map it directly to ""MAP2K7"" without the pp because the name might imply the state. Alternatively, perhaps the user decided not to include the state for s43, but included it for s44.\n\nI think I should follow the sample and map s43 to ""MAP2K7"" without the pp.\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s104"": ""MAPK8"",\n  ""s44"": ""MAPK8_pp"",\n  ""s43"": ""MAP2K7""\n}\n\nI think that\'s how the user expects it based on their sample. I should make sure each id is mapped correctly, considering the name and reference, and including states where appropriate.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

Since p-JNK is already a standard abbreviation, maybe I can use MAPK8 directly. So s104 should be ""MAPK8"".\n\nNext, s44 is pp-JNK with the same reference MAPK8. pp-JNK stands for diphosphorylated JNK. But since the reference is still MAPK8, perhaps it\'s better to just use ""MAPK8_pp"" to denote the phosphorylated state. Alternatively, if the name is pp-JNK, maybe it\'s better to keep it as is, but since the reference is MAPK8, perhaps combining both. Hmm, but the guideline says if the name is reasonably interpretable, don\'t change it. So maybe s44 should be ""pp_JNK"".\n\nWait, but the guideline says to use single words. So ""pp_JNK"" would be a single word with an underscore. That makes sense. So s44 would be ""pp_JNK"".\n\nNow, s43 is pp-JNKK with references to MAP2K7. JNKK is JNK kinase, which is part of the MAP kinase kinase family, specifically MAP2K7. So pp-JNKK could be ""MAP2K7_pp"" or just ""MAP2K7"" if the state isn\'t necessary. But the name is pp-JNKK, which is a specific form. So maybe it\'s better to use ""pp_JNKK"" as a single word.\n\nWait, but the user said that if a simple abbreviation is interpretable, don\'t make changes. So pp-JNKK is already an abbreviation, so maybe just use ""pp_JNKK"" as the term. But looking at the replacement table, the name is pp-JNKK, and the reference is MAP2K7. So perhaps the more interpretable term would be MAP2K7, but since the name is pp-JNKK, which is specific, maybe better to keep it as ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nWait, but the guideline says to prioritize the name column. So for s43, the name is pp-JNKK, which is already a single word if we replace the space with an underscore. So s43 would be ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nSo compiling this:\n\ns104: p-JNK maps to MAPK8, but since the name is p-JNK, perhaps ""p_JNK"" is better. But the guideline says if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change. But p-JNK is an abbreviation, so maybe just ""p_JNK"". Alternatively, the reference is MAPK8, which is more specific. So perhaps ""MAPK8"".\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" as a single word, so maybe ""p_JNK"" is acceptable as a single word. Alternatively, using the reference, ""MAPK8"" is more precise. I think using the reference is better for clarity, so s104 would be ""MAPK8"".\n\nSimilarly, s44 is pp-JNK, which would be ""pp_JNK"".\n\ns43 is pp-JNKK, which would be ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s104"": ""MAPK8"",\n  ""s44"": ""pp_JNK"",\n  ""s43"": ""pp_JNKK""\n}\n\nWait, but the user\'s example in the guidelines used ""R"" and ""L"" as part of the term, so maybe for s104, since it\'s a reactant and product, perhaps the state matters. But in the equation, s104 is a reactant turning into s44, which is the product. So s104 is p-JNK, which is phosphorylated, and s44 is pp-JNK, which is doubly phosphorylated. So perhaps for s104, it\'s better to keep it as ""p_JNK"" to show the single phosphorylation state, and s44 as ""pp_JNK"" for double phosphorylation.\n\nAlternatively, using the references, s104 is MAPK8, and s44 is MAPK8 as well, but in a different state. So maybe s104 is ""MAPK8_p"" and s44 is ""MAPK8_pp"".\n\nBut the guideline says to use the name column first, so perhaps it\'s better to use the names as is, converting spaces to underscores.\n\nSo s104: ""p_JNK"", s44: ""pp_JNK"", s43: ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nBut then, considering the references, s104 and s44 both refer to MAPK8, just in different phosphorylation states. So maybe it\'s better to use the reference term with the state.\n\nSo s104 would be ""MAPK8_p"", s44 as ""MAPK8_pp"", and s43 as ""MAP2K7"" since it\'s the kinase.\n\nWait, but the name for s43 is pp-JNKK, which is the diphosphorylated form of JNKK, which is MAP2K7. So perhaps s43 should be ""MAP2K7_pp"".\n\nAlternatively, the name is pp-JNKK, which is a specific form, so perhaps better to use that.\n\nI think the key is to use the name column first, then the reference. So for s104, name is p-JNK, so ""p_JNK""; s44 is pp-JNK, so ""pp_JNK""; s43 is pp-JNKK, so ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nBut the references for s104 and s44 are MAPK8, which is the same enzyme in different states. So maybe using the reference with the state would be more accurate.\n\nBut the guideline says to prioritize the name column for consistency. So perhaps the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""s104"": ""p_JNK"",\n  ""s44"": ""pp_JNK"",\n  ""s43"": ""pp_JNKK""\n}\n\nAlternatively, using the references, perhaps s104 is ""MAPK8_p"", s44 is ""MAPK8_pp"", and s43 is ""MAP2K7_pp"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure. The user\'s example used the name column, so maybe better to stick with that.\n\nI think I\'ll go with the name column, converting spaces to underscores, so s104 is ""p_JNK"", s44 is ""pp_JNK"", and s43 is ""pp_JNKK"".\n\nBut wait, in the replacement table, s104 appears in both reactants and modifiers. So perhaps the term should be consistent across all roles. But since the name is the same, it\'s okay.\n\nSo the final JSON would map each id to their respective names with underscores.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

If the term is already an abbreviation or clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Also, prioritize the phrasing from the name column for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input. There\'s an equation: s99 => s104; s43, s99, s43. The replacement table has three rows, but I notice that s99 and s43 are listed twice with the same names and references. I think this might be a duplication, but maybe it\'s intentional for clarity.\n\nThe replacement table is:\n\n| role      | id   | name    | references   |\n|:----------|:-----|:--------|:-------------|\n| reactants | s99  | JNK     | MAPK8        |\n| products  | s104 | p-JNK   | MAPK8        |\n| modifiers | s43  | pp-JNKK | MAP2K7       |\n| modifiers | s99  | JNK     | MAPK8        |\n| modifiers | s43  | pp-JNKK | MAP2K7       |\n\nSo, the ids to map are s99, s104, and s43. Let\'s process each one.\n\nStarting with s99. The name is JNK, and the reference is MAPK8. JNK is an abbreviation for c-Jun N-terminal kinase, but in biological terms, MAPK8 is a more specific identifier. Since JNK is a common abbreviation, but the user wants biologically interpretable terms, which might mean using the gene symbol or specific name. However, the guidelines say if the term is reasonably interpretable, we don\'t need to change it. JNK is well-known, so maybe we can keep it as JNK. But wait, the reference is MAPK8, which is the gene symbol for JNK. So, perhaps using MAPK8 would be more precise. But the name column says JNK, and the guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So I think we should use JNK.\n\nNext, s104. The name is p-JNK, which stands for phosphorylated JNK. The reference is also MAPK8. So p-JNK is a modified form of JNK. Since the name is p-JNK, and it\'s a single word, we can keep it as p_JNK, using the underscore as per the guidelines for states. Alternatively, since the reference is MAPK8, but the name is p-JNK, we should use p_JNK to indicate the phosphorylated state.\n\nThen, s43. The name is pp-JNKK, which I believe stands for phospho-phospho-JNK kinase. But wait, JNKK is the kinase that phosphorylates JNK, which is MAP2K7. The name is pp-JNKK, but the reference is MAP2K7. MAP2K7 is also known as MKK7, which is a kinase that activates JNK. So pp-JNKK might refer to a doubly phosphorylated form of the kinase. However, the name in the table is pp-JNKK, so we should use that as it\'s in the name column. Since it\'s a single word when connected with underscores, it becomes pp_JNKK.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example uses ""R"" and ""L"" as abbreviations for receptor and ligand. So if the term has R or L, we connect them with an underscore. In this case, none of the terms have R or L, so we don\'t need to do that here.\n\nAnother thing to consider: for s43, the name is pp-JNKK, and the reference is MAP2K7. Since MAP2K7 is the gene symbol, but the name is pp-JNKK, we should stick with the name. So the term becomes pp_JNKK.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should map:\n\n- s99 to JNK\n- s104 to p_JNK\n- s43 to pp_JNKK\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me double-check to make sure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to use single words, so using underscores is acceptable for connecting parts or states. Since the names are JNK, p-JNK, and pp-JNKK, converting them to JNK, p_JNK, and pp_JNKK fits the requirements. Also, since the references are MAPK8 and MAP2K7, but the names are more interpretable as JNK and pp-JNKK, we prioritize the names.

Let me start by understanding the guidelines.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, the replacement table doesn\'t have ""R"" or ""L"", so maybe I don\'t need to worry about that here.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is AKT => AKTp; PI3K. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n1. role: reactants, id: AKT, name: AKT, references: AKT1\n2. role: products, id: AKTp, name: AKTp, references: AKT1\n3. role: modifiers, id: PI3K, name: PI3K, references: PIK3R1\n\nSo, I need to map each id to a biologically interpretable term.\n\nStarting with AKT. The name is AKT, and the reference is AKT1. Since AKT is a well-known abbreviation for Protein Kinase B, and AKT1 is one of its isoforms. However, the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it significantly. So I can just use ""AKT"".\n\nNext, AKTp. The name is AKTp, which stands for phosphorylated AKT. The reference is also AKT1. So in biological terms, phosphorylated AKT is often denoted as AKT_p or p-AKT. But since the name is AKTp, maybe it\'s acceptable to keep it as ""AKTp"". Alternatively, I could write it as ""AKT_p"" for clarity, but the guidelines suggest using the name column if possible, so I\'ll stick with ""AKTp"".\n\nLastly, PI3K. The name is PI3K, and the reference is PIK3R1. PI3K stands for Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase. PIK3R1 is the regulatory subunit of PI3K. However, the name column uses ""PI3K"", which is the common abbreviation. Since it\'s a well-known term, I can keep it as ""PI3K"".\n\nWait, but looking back, the guidelines mention that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. For PI3K, the reference is PIK3R1, which is a component of PI3K. But the name is PI3K, which is the general term. So I think it\'s better to use ""PI3K"" as it\'s more interpretable in biological contexts.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON object should have:\n\n- ""AKT"": ""AKT""\n- ""AKTp"": ""AKTp""\n- ""PI3K"": ""PI3K""\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check if any terms need further refinement. AKT and AKTp are straightforward. PI3K is a common term, so no need to change. I don\'t see any need to add states like ""bound"" or ""active"" here since the names are sufficient. Also, none of these are receptors or ligands, so no underscores needed. \n\nYes, that should be it.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input, there\'s an equation: species_17 => species_16; species_14. But I think the main focus is on the replacement table provided. The table has three rows with roles, ids, names, and references.\n\nThe guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. So, I need to make sure that each id maps to a single word term. Also, if the term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, looking at the replacement table, the roles are reactants, products, and modifiers, not receptors or ligands. So maybe that part doesn\'t apply here.\n\nNext, if the name and references have similar terms, I should prioritize the name column. For example, species_17 has name AKT and reference AKT1. So, AKT is straightforward. But species_16 has name pAKT and reference AKT1. pAKT stands for phosphorylated AKT, so maybe I can represent it as AKT_p or something similar.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we don\'t need to change it. So pAKT is already a standard term, so maybe just keep it as pAKT. Similarly, species_14 is PI3K_Active, and the reference is PIK3R1. PI3K is a common abbreviation for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase. The active form might be represented as PI3K_active, but the name is already PI3K_Active. So maybe just convert it to lowercase or keep the format as per guidelines.\n\nBut the guidelines don\'t specify case sensitivity, so perhaps it\'s better to keep the original casing as in the name column. So PI3K_Active would stay as is, but I should check if there\'s a more standard way to represent active states. Sometimes, people use underscores, like PI3K_active. But since the name is PI3K_Active, I can map it directly.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nspecies_17 maps to AKT, species_16 maps to pAKT, and species_14 maps to PI3K_Active.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. The guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine using references. For species_14, the name is PI3K_Active, and the reference is PIK3R1. PIK3R1 is a regulatory subunit of PI3K, but the name is already PI3K_Active, which is a functional state. So I think it\'s okay to use PI3K_Active as the term.\n\nSimilarly, for species_17, AKT is a well-known protein, so AKT is fine. Species_16 is pAKT, which is phosphorylated AKT, so pAKT is acceptable.\n\nI don\'t see any need to change these terms further because they are already biologically interpretable as single words. Receptor and ligand terms aren\'t present here, so I don\'t need to create underscores for those.\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""species_17"": ""AKT"",\n  ""species_16"": ""pAKT"",\n  ""species_14"": ""PI3K_Active""\n}\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines.

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If the term is ambiguous, I should use context or references to make it more interpretable. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name` using the table, then refine it using references.\n\nThe user provided an equation: pERK + GSK3B => pERK + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries, two reactants and two products. The `id`s are pERK, GSK3B, pERK again, and pGSK3B. The names are pERK, GSK3b, pERK, and pGSK3b. The references for pERK and pGSK3B are both pointing to MAPK1 and urn:miriam:bao:0002007.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, the `id`s are already pERK and GSK3B, and their names are pERK and GSK3b. So, the first step is to map each `id` to its `name`. For pERK, the name is pERK, and for GSK3B, the name is GSK3b. Similarly, the products are pERK and pGSK3B, which map to pERK and pGSK3b.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines, since the `id`s are already biologically interpretable as abbreviations, I don\'t need to make significant changes. pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK, and GSK3B is a known kinase. The references both point to MAPK1, but since the names are already clear, I don\'t need to change them. \n\nI also need to ensure that each term is a single word. pERK and GSK3b are both single words. The user didn\'t mention any receptors or ligands in this case, so I don\'t need to create terms with underscores. Also, there\'s no mention of states like ""bound"" or ""active,"" so I won\'t add those.\n\nSo, the JSON object should have keys as the `id`s and values as the corresponding `name`s. That would be:\n\n{\n  ""pERK"": ""pERK"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nI think that covers all the points. The user wanted each `id` mapped correctly without unnecessary changes, and I\'ve followed the guidelines to ensure the terms are biologically accurate and interpretable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Hmm, I need to look for those cases in the data.\n\nThe user also pointed out that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first mapping the `id` to `name`, and then refining it using references. I should keep that in mind because some terms might need more context to be accurately interpreted. \n\nAnother important point is including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" by joining them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". So, if the term refers to a specific state, I need to incorporate that into the single word.\n\nIf the term is a simple abbreviation and is already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it. That means I should only alter terms when necessary for clarity or biological accuracy. \n\nThe replacement table provided has the following data:\n\n| role      | id     | name   | references   |\n|:----------|:-------|:-------|:-------------|\n| reactants | pERK   | pERK   | MAPK1        |\n| reactants | GSK3B  | GSK3b  | GSK3B        |\n| products  | pERK   | pERK   | MAPK1        |\n| products  | pGSK3B | pGSK3b | GSK3B        |\n\nSo, looking at the `id` and `name` columns, ""pERK"" and ""GSK3B"" are already the same in `id` and `name`. The references column shows that ""pERK"" maps to ""MAPK1"" and ""GSK3B"" maps to ""GSK3B"". \n\nI need to map each `id` to its interpretable term. Let\'s go through each entry:\n\n1. **pERK**: The `name` is also ""pERK"", and the reference is ""MAPK1"". I know that pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK. ERK is a MAPK, so MAPK1 is the specific isoform. However, since the user wants a single word and the `name` is already ""pERK"", I can just use ""pERK"" as it\'s a standard abbreviation in biology.\n\n2. **GSK3B**: The `name` is ""GSK3b"" (note the lowercase \'b\'), and the reference is ""GSK3B"". I think the lowercase is just a typo, and the correct term is ""GSK3B"". So, the `id` is ""GSK3B"", and the `name` is ""GSK3b"". I should probably use the `id` as it\'s the key, so ""GSK3B"".\n\n3. **pGSK3B**: The `name` is ""pGSK3b"", and the reference is ""GSK3B"". Again, lowercase \'b\' might be a typo. So, the `id` is ""pGSK3B"", which is phosphorylated GSK3B. Since the user wants a single word, I can keep it as ""pGSK3B"".\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands in the terms, so I don\'t need to combine them with underscores. Also, there\'s no mention of states like ""bound"" or ""active"", so I can skip that part.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map each `id` to its respective term. \n\nWait, let me double-check the guidelines again. They said that if the `name` and `reference` have synonyms, prioritize the `name` for consistency. In this case, ""pERK"" maps to ""MAPK1"", but the `name` is ""pERK"", so I should use that. Similarly, ""GSK3B"" is the same in both `id` and `name`, so no issue there.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the points. Now, I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. I also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore.\n\nThe input they provided includes an equation: pERK + GSK3B => pERK + pGSK3B. There\'s a replacement table with IDs, names, and references. Let me go through each ID one by one.\n\nStarting with pERK in the reactants. The name is pERK, and the reference mentions MAPK1. MAPK1 is a known protein, so maybe pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK. But according to the guidelines, if it\'s already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it. So pERK remains pERK.\n\nNext is GSK3B. The name is GSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. The name uses a lowercase \'b\', but the ID is uppercase. Since the name is consistent, maybe I should just keep it as GSK3B. But wait, the guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So I\'ll use GSK3b as the term.\n\nLooking at the products, pERK is again present, so same as before. The other product is pGSK3B. The name is pGSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. Following the same logic, I\'ll use pGSK3b as the term.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines about receptors and ligands. In this case, I don\'t see any R or L in the IDs, so I don\'t need to create terms like IL6_R. Also, there\'s no mention of states like active or bound, so I won\'t add those.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each ID to its respective term. For reactants, pERK maps to pERK, GSK3B maps to GSK3b. For products, pERK stays pERK, and pGSK3B maps to pGSK3b. So the JSON object will have these mappings.\n\nI need to make sure I don\'t include any explanations, just the JSON. Also, ensure that all terms are single words and follow the guidelines correctly. I think that\'s all, so I\'ll structure the JSON accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the IL6 receptor, it becomes ""IL6_R"". Similarly, for ligands like ""L"" connected to CSF1R, it becomes ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nThe user mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. So, first, I map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then I refine it using the references provided. This is important because the references might have more context or specific terms that I should prioritize.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term, connected by an underscore. For example, if there\'s a receptor in an active state, it would be something like ""IL6_R_active"". But if the term is already a simple abbreviation or easily interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. The priority is to keep it consistent and clear, so I should stick with the phrasing from the `name` column if possible.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is pERK + GSK3B => pERK + pGSK3B.\n\nThe replacement table has four entries. Let\'s go through each one:\n\n1. For the reactant pERK, the name is pERK, and the references mention BAO:0002007 and MAPK1. So pERK is phosphorylated ERK, which is a form of MAPK1. Since the name is straightforward and matches the id, I don\'t need to change it. So the term is ""pERK"".\n\n2. GSK3B is another reactant. The name is GSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. The name is in lowercase, but the reference is uppercase. I should prioritize the `name` column, so it becomes ""GSK3b"".\n\n3. In the products, pERK again is mapped to the same term, so ""pERK"".\n\n4. pGSK3B is the product. The name is pGSK3b, and the reference points to BAO:0002007 and GSK3B. So, similar to the reactant, the term should be ""pGSK3b"".\n\nI need to make sure that each id is mapped correctly. Since the names in the `name` column are already biologically interpretable and single words, I don\'t need to do any further modification beyond using the names as they are.\n\nSo, compiling this into a JSON object, each key is the id, and the value is the corresponding term from the `name` column.', '', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it\'s for IL6, it should become ""IL6_R"". Same with ligands, like ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nBut wait, sometimes the names aren\'t in the ""name"" column. So I might have to use context from the references or elsewhere to figure out the right substitution. Also, in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name using the table, then refine it using the references for accuracy.\n\nThey also want to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" by joining them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". That makes sense because it adds context about the state of the molecule.\n\nHowever, if the term is already an abbreviation or clear enough, I shouldn\'t change it too much. Consistency is key, so I should prioritize the phrasing from the ""name"" column when possible.\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided, the equation is pERK + GSK3B => pERK + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries. Let me go through each one.\n\nFor the reactants, pERK is already named pERK and references BAO:0002007 and MAPK1. Since it\'s an abbreviation, I should keep it as pERK. Similarly, GSK3B is in the reactants with the same name, so that should stay GSK3B.\n\nIn the products, pERK is again the same, so it remains pERK. Then pGSK3B is named pGSK3b in the replacement table. Hmm, the id is pGSK3B, but the name is pGSK3b. I need to make sure I\'m consistent. Since the name is in lowercase \'b\', should I adjust the id? But the user\'s example used ""R"" and ""L"" with uppercase. Wait, in the example, ""R"" became ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" became ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps the case matters. So the id pGSK3B would be mapped to pGSK3b as per the name.\n\nBut wait, the id is pGSK3B, and the name is pGSK3b. So I need to map the id to the name, which is pGSK3b. But the user\'s guideline says to map the id to the name. So the key in the JSON is the id, and the value is the name, but perhaps further refined if necessary.\n\nWait, but the user also mentioned that in some cases, a two-step process is needed: first map id to name, then refine using references. So let me check the references. For pERK, the references are urn:miriam:bao:0002007 and MAPK1. BAO:0002007 is the BAO identifier for pERK. MAPK1 is the gene symbol for ERK. So perhaps the name is pERK, which is already an abbreviation for phosphorylated ERK. Similarly, GSK3B is the gene symbol for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its name as given, but if there\'s a need for further refinement, perhaps using the references. But in this case, the names are already pretty clear. pERK is pERK, GSK3B is GSK3B, same for the products.\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, the products have pGSK3B as the id and pGSK3b as the name. So the id is pGSK3B, but the name is pGSK3b. So the JSON should map ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3b""? Or should I use the id as the key and the name as the value? I think so, because the guideline says to map each id to the corresponding term.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON would have keys as the ids and values as the names. So:\n\n{\n  ""pERK"": ""pERK"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3B"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nWait, but the user\'s example had ""R"" and ""L"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So if the id is ""R"" and the name is ""R"", but the context is that it\'s a receptor, then we combine it with the ligand name. But in this case, the ids are pERK and GSK3B, which are already proteins, not receptors or ligands. So perhaps no need to combine them.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s equation is pERK + GSK3B => pERK + pGSK3B. So pERK is a reactant and product, and GSK3B becomes pGSK3B. So in the replacement table, the products have pGSK3B with the name pGSK3b.\n\nSo in the JSON, the id is pGSK3B, and the name is pGSK3b. So the mapping would be ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut the user\'s guidelines say to make it a single word. So pGSK3b is a single word. So that\'s fine.\n\nWait, but in the input, the replacement table has for products, pGSK3B with name pGSK3b. So the id is pGSK3B, but the name is pGSK3b. So the JSON should map ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut the user\'s guidelines also mention that if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to make significant changes. So pGSK3B is already an abbreviation, so perhaps we can leave it as pGSK3B, but the name is pGSK3b. So should I use the name or the id?\n\nWait, the user\'s instruction is to map each id to its corresponding biologically interpretable term based on the replacement table. So the replacement table has id and name. So the key is the id, and the value is the name, unless further refinement is needed.\n\nSo for pERK, the name is pERK, so it stays. GSK3B\'s name is GSK3b, so the JSON would map ""GSK3B"" to ""GSK3b"". Similarly, pGSK3B\'s name is pGSK3b, so ""pGSK3B"" maps to ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut wait, the reactants have GSK3B with name GSK3b. So in the JSON, the key is ""GSK3B"" and the value is ""GSK3b"".\n\nSimilarly, pGSK3B is the id, and the name is pGSK3b, so the value is ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut the user\'s example had ""R"" and ""L"" becoming ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", implying that the id is R and L, but the name is something else. So perhaps in that case, the name wasn\'t in the name column, so they had to infer from the references.\n\nIn our case, the names are provided, so we can use them directly.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should be:\n\n{\n  ""pERK"": ""pERK"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, the reactants have GSK3B with name GSK3b. So the id is GSK3B, and the name is GSK3b. So the JSON maps ""GSK3B"" to ""GSK3b"".\n\nSimilarly, pERK maps to pERK, and pGSK3B maps to pGSK3b.\n\nBut in the user\'s output example, they didn\'t change the case. So perhaps we should keep the case as is, unless the name column changes it.\n\nWait, but the name column for GSK3B is GSK3b, which is lowercase \'b\'. So perhaps we should follow that.\n\nSo the JSON would have:\n\n{\n  ""pERK"": ""pERK"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused because the id is GSK3B, but the name is GSK3b. So should I map ""GSK3B"" to ""GSK3b""?\n\nYes, according to the replacement table, the name is GSK3b, so the JSON should reflect that.\n\nSo the final JSON is:\n\n{\n  ""pERK"": ""pERK"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the correct mapping based on the replacement table and guidelines.', '', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the guidelines and the input data provided.\n\nFirst, the input includes an equation: X5 => X28; X23. Then, there\'s a replacement table with three rows, each containing role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines mention that each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. X5 is GSK3beta, references GSK3B.\n2. X28 is also GSK3beta, references GSK3B.\n3. X23 is ERK_ast, references MAPK1.\n\nStarting with X5: The name is GSK3beta, and the reference is GSK3B. Since GSK3beta is a well-known abbreviation for glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and the reference GSK3B is another abbreviation. Both are single words, so no need for further changes. So, X5 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nNext, X28 is the same as X5: GSK3beta. So, it maps to GSK3beta as well.\n\nX23 is ERK_ast. The name is ERK_ast, which seems to be an abbreviation. The reference is MAPK1. ERK is a type of MAP kinase, specifically extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The ""_ast"" might indicate an activated state, perhaps ""active"". So, combining the receptor/ligand idea, if ERK is a kinase (not a receptor or ligand), but considering the state, maybe it\'s ERK_active. However, the guidelines say if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much. ERK_ast is a bit ambiguous. The reference is MAPK1, which is the more specific name. So, perhaps using MAPK1 would be better for clarity and biological accuracy. But the guideline also says to prioritize the name column if possible. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, ERK_ast might be short for ERK active. So, the term could be ERK_active. But since the name is ERK_ast, maybe I should use that as the term, but considering the reference, it\'s better to use MAPK1.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the name and reference have synonyms, prioritize the name. So, maybe I should use ERK_ast as the term for X23, but I\'m not sure if that\'s biologically accurate. ERK is a well-known term, so ERK_ast might be a way to denote its active state. Alternatively, using MAPK1 is more precise, but the guideline suggests using the name if possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct mapping for X23 is ERK_ast, as per the name column, but the reference is MAPK1. Since the name is ERK_ast, maybe that\'s acceptable as a single word. Or should I combine it? Wait, the guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine with references. So, for X23, first map to ERK_ast, then see if the reference helps. Since the reference is MAPK1, which is a more specific term, perhaps I should use that instead for clarity and accuracy.\n\nBut the guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so maybe I should use ERK_ast. Alternatively, perhaps ERK_ast can be interpreted as ERK in an active state, so ERK_active would be a better term. Since the name is ERK_ast, perhaps the intended meaning is active ERK, so ERK_active is a more interpretable term.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nX5 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nX28 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nX23 maps to ERK_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it. ERK_ast is a bit ambiguous, but ERK is a well-known term. So, perhaps I should use ERK, but the name is ERK_ast. Alternatively, using MAPK1 is more precise, but the guideline suggests using the name.\n\nAlternatively, since the role is modifiers, perhaps it\'s indicating that ERK is in a certain state, so ERK_ast could be ERK active, hence ERK_active.\n\nSo, I think the correct JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""X5"": ""GSK3beta"",\n  ""X28"": ""GSK3beta"",\n  ""X23"": ""ERK_active""\n}\n\nBut wait, the guidelines also mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. ERK is a kinase, not a receptor or ligand, so that doesn\'t apply here. So, perhaps I should just use the name as is, but considering the state.\n\nAlternatively, since the reference is MAPK1, perhaps using that as the term is better, but the guideline says to prioritize the name. So, maybe the correct approach is to use ERK_ast, but I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term. ERK_active is more interpretable.\n\nI think I\'ll go with ERK_active for X23.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The replacement table has four entries: two reactants (pERK and GSK3B) and two products (pERK and pGSK3B). The names are mostly the same as the ids, except GSK3B is written as GSK3b in the name column.\n\nI need to check if any terms are ambiguous or if they can be replaced with more specific terms using the references. For pERK, the references point to BAO:0002007 and MAPK1. Since pERK is a common abbreviation for phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is MAPK1, it might be better to use the full name or the standardized term.\n\nGSK3B is GSK3b in the name, which is the beta isoform of glycogen synthase kinase-3. The reference for GSK3B is itself, so maybe it\'s already the most specific term.\n\nNow, considering the products, pGSK3B is named as pGSK3b. Since the reactants have GSK3B and the products have pGSK3B, it makes sense to map them as pGSK3b in the JSON to reflect phosphorylation.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is a simple abbreviation, we shouldn\'t make significant changes unless necessary. pERK is a standard abbreviation, so maybe it\'s fine as is. Similarly, GSK3B is a standard name, so perhaps we can leave it as GSK3B.\n\nBut looking at the replacement table, the name for GSK3B is GSK3b. Since the name is slightly different, maybe I should prioritize that for consistency. So, in the JSON, GSK3B would map to GSK3b.\n\nFor pERK, the name is pERK, so it remains pERK. The same applies to the product pGSK3B, which maps to pGSK3b.\n\nWait, but the products have pGSK3B as the id and pGSK3b as the name. So in the JSON, the key would be pGSK3B, and the value would be pGSK3b.\n\nI should make sure each id is mapped correctly. Let me list them out:\n\n- pERK (reactant) → pERK\n- GSK3B (reactant) → GSK3b\n- pERK (product) → pERK\n- pGSK3B (product) → pGSK3b\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to combine terms with underscores. The states like active or bound aren\'t mentioned, so I don\'t need to add those either.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have each id as a key with their corresponding name as the value. I need to ensure that the casing is consistent, as in the table, GSK3B is in uppercase in the id but lowercase in the name.\n\nSo the final JSON should map each id correctly, using the names provided in the table.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through their guidelines step by step to make sure I understand what they need.\n\nFirst, the guidelines mention that each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t use multiple words or phrases; it has to be concise. They also mentioned replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones based on the replacement table. If a term is a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Hmm, I need to look for those cases in the data.\n\nThe user also pointed out that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first mapping the `id` to `name`, and then refining it using references. I should keep that in mind because some terms might need more context to be accurately interpreted. \n\nAnother important point is including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" by joining them with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". So, if the term refers to a specific state, I need to incorporate that into the single word.\n\nIf the term is a simple abbreviation and is already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it. That means I should only alter terms when necessary for clarity or biological accuracy. \n\nThe replacement table provided has the following data:\n\n| role      | id     | name   | references   |\n|:----------|:-------|:-------|:-------------|\n| reactants | pERK   | pERK   | MAPK1        |\n| reactants | GSK3B  | GSK3b  | GSK3B        |\n| products  | pERK   | pERK   | MAPK1        |\n| products  | pGSK3B | pGSK3b | GSK3B        |\n\nSo, looking at the `id` and `name` columns, ""pERK"" and ""GSK3B"" are already the same in `id` and `name`. The references column shows that ""pERK"" maps to ""MAPK1"" and ""GSK3B"" maps to ""GSK3B"". \n\nI need to map each `id` to its interpretable term. Let\'s go through each entry:\n\n1. **pERK**: The `name` is also ""pERK"", and the reference is ""MAPK1"". I know that pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK. ERK is a MAPK, so MAPK1 is the specific isoform. However, since the user wants a single word and the `name` is already ""pERK"", I can just use ""pERK"" as it\'s a standard abbreviation in biology.\n\n2. **GSK3B**: The `name` is ""GSK3b"" (note the lowercase \'b\'), and the reference is ""GSK3B"". I think the lowercase is just a typo, and the correct term is ""GSK3B"". So, the `id` is ""GSK3B"", and the `name` is ""GSK3b"". I should probably use the `id` as it\'s the key, so ""GSK3B"".\n\n3. **pGSK3B**: The `name` is ""pGSK3b"", and the reference is ""GSK3B"". Again, lowercase \'b\' might be a typo. So, the `id` is ""pGSK3B"", which is phosphorylated GSK3B. Since the user wants a single word, I can keep it as ""pGSK3B"".\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands in the terms, so I don\'t need to combine them with underscores.

They said that if the `name` and `reference` have synonyms, prioritize the `name` for consistency. In this case, ""pERK"" maps to ""MAPK1"", but the `name` is ""pERK"", so I should use that.

The user wanted each `id` mapped correctly without unnecessary changes, and I\'ve followed the guidelines to ensure the terms are biologically accurate and interpretable.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the guidelines and the input data provided.\n\nFirst, the input includes an equation: X5 => X28; X23. Then, there\'s a replacement table with three rows, each containing role, id, name, and references.\n\nThe guidelines mention that each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. X5 is GSK3beta, references GSK3B.\n2. X28 is also GSK3beta, references GSK3B.\n3. X23 is ERK_ast, references MAPK1.\n\nStarting with X5: The name is GSK3beta, and the reference is GSK3B. Since GSK3beta is a well-known abbreviation for glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta, and the reference GSK3B is another abbreviation. Both are single words, so no need for further changes. So, X5 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nNext, X28 is the same as X5: GSK3beta. So, it maps to GSK3beta as well.\n\nX23 is ERK_ast. The name is ERK_ast, which seems to be an abbreviation. The reference is MAPK1. ERK is a type of MAP kinase, specifically extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The ""_ast"" might indicate an activated state, perhaps ""active"". So, combining the receptor/ligand idea, if ERK is a kinase (not a receptor or ligand), but considering the state, maybe it\'s ERK_active. However, the guidelines say if the term is interpretable as-is, don\'t change it much. ERK_ast is a bit ambiguous. The reference is MAPK1, which is the more specific name. So, perhaps using MAPK1 would be better for clarity and biological accuracy. But the guideline also says to prioritize the name column if possible. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n\nAlternatively, ERK_ast might be short for ERK active. So, the term could be ERK_active. But since the name is ERK_ast, maybe I should use that as the term, but considering the reference, it\'s better to use MAPK1.\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the name and reference have synonyms, prioritize the name. So, maybe I should use ERK_ast as the term for X23, but I\'m not sure if that\'s biologically accurate. ERK is a well-known term, so ERK_ast might be a way to denote its active state. Alternatively, using MAPK1 is more precise, but the guideline suggests using the name if possible.\n\nSo, perhaps the correct mapping for X23 is ERK_ast, as per the name column, but the reference is MAPK1. Since the name is ERK_ast, maybe that\'s acceptable as a single word. Or should I combine it? Wait, the guidelines mention that if a two-step process is needed, first map id to name, then refine with references. So, for X23, first map to ERK_ast, then see if the reference helps. Since the reference is MAPK1, which is a more specific term, perhaps I should use that instead for clarity and accuracy.\n\nBut the guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so maybe I should use ERK_ast. Alternatively, perhaps ERK_ast can be interpreted as ERK in an active state, so ERK_active would be a better term. Since the name is ERK_ast, perhaps the intended meaning is active ERK, so ERK_active is a more interpretable term.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\nX5 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nX28 maps to GSK3beta.\n\nX23 maps to ERK_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it. ERK_ast is a bit ambiguous, but ERK is a well-known term. So, perhaps I should use ERK, but the name is ERK_ast. Alternatively, using MAPK1 is more precise, but the guideline suggests using the name.\n\nAlternatively, since the role is modifiers, perhaps it\'s indicating that ERK is in a certain state, so ERK_ast could be ERK active, hence ERK_active.\n\nSo, I think the correct JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""X5"": ""GSK3beta"",\n  ""X28"": ""GSK3beta"",\n  ""X23"": ""ERK_active""\n}\n\nBut wait, the guidelines also mention that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. ERK is a kinase, not a receptor or ligand, so that doesn\'t apply here. So, perhaps I should just use the name as is, but considering the state.\n\nAlternatively, since the reference is MAPK1, perhaps using that as the term is better, but the guideline says to prioritize the name. So, maybe the correct approach is to use ERK_ast, but I\'m not sure if that\'s a standard term.

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, let\'s look at the replacement table they provided. The table has four columns: role, id, name, and references. There are two rows. The first row is for reactants with id mw8a358487_b18b_42df_a646_cd75eb5bfcc2, name NFkB, and reference NFKB1. The second row is for products with id mwc844b7c0_98f5_4d0d_8f0c_00dfe8b54e6d, name TNF, and reference TNF.\n\nThe guidelines say that each term in the JSON object must be a single word. If the term is a simple abbreviation and can be interpreted as-is, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. Also, if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we might need to combine them with an underscore, like IL6_R or CSF1R_L. But in this case, the names are NFkB and TNF, which are already common abbreviations in biology.\n\nLooking at the first id, mw8a358487_b18b_42df_a646_cd75eb5bfcc2, the name is NFkB. The reference is NFKB1, which is the gene symbol for NF-κB. Since NFkB is a well-known abbreviation, it\'s better to use that rather than the gene symbol. So the term for this id should be ""NFkB"".\n\nThe second id, mwc844b7c0_98f5_4d0d_8f0c_00dfe8b54e6d, has the name TNF and the reference TNF. TNF is the standard abbreviation for Tumor Necrosis Factor, so using ""TNF"" is appropriate here.\n\nThe user also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed, but in this case, the names are already clear and don\'t require further mapping or refinement. There\'s no indication that these terms are ambiguous or need to be expanded into receptor or ligand forms. Also, there are no states like ""bound"" or ""active"" mentioned, so we don\'t need to include those.\n\nTherefore, the JSON object should map each id to its respective name directly. The result would be a simple mapping without any additional changes.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If the term is ambiguous, I should use context or references to make it more interpretable. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation and makes sense, I shouldn\'t change it much. The user also mentioned that if the name and reference columns have similar terms, I should prioritize the name for consistency.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is:\nspecies_39 => species_24 + species_39; species_39\n\nAnd the replacement table is:\n\n| role      | id         | name      | references   |\n|:----------|:-----------|:----------|:-------------|\n| reactants | species_39 | NFkB(nuc) | NFKB1        |\n| products  | species_24 | TNFa      | TNF          |\n| products  | species_39 | NFkB(nuc) | NFKB1        |\n| modifiers | species_39 | NFkB(nuc) | NFKB1        |\n\nSo, I need to map each id to a term. Let\'s go through each id.\n\nStarting with species_39. The name is NFkB(nuc), and the reference is NFKB1. NFkB(nuc) stands for Nuclear Factor kappa B in the nucleus. The reference NFKB1 is another name for the same thing. The term is already a bit interpretable, but it\'s in parentheses. The user says to avoid significant changes if it\'s already an abbreviation, but in this case, NFkB(nuc) is a bit ambiguous because it\'s not a single word. Maybe I should make it a single word by removing the parentheses. So, NFkB_nuc.\n\nNext, species_24. The name is TNFa, and the reference is TNF. TNFa is an abbreviation for Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha. Since the name is TNFa, which is a common abbreviation, and the reference is TNF, which is the general term. The guideline says to prioritize the name, so I should use TNFa as it\'s more specific. But the user wants a single word. TNFa is already a single word, so that\'s fine.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON object should map species_39 to NFkB_nuc and species_24 to TNFa.\n\nWait, let me double-check. The user\'s example showed that if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we connect with an underscore. But NFkB is a transcription factor, not a receptor or ligand, so maybe I don\'t need to change it that way. Also, the state is ""nuc"", which stands for nuclear. So NFkB_nuc makes sense as a single term.\n\nI think that\'s all. So the final JSON would be:\n{\n  ""species_24"": ""TNFa"",\n  ""species_39"": ""NFkB_nuc""\n}', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If the term is ambiguous, I should use context or references to make it more interpretable. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term with an underscore. If the term is already an abbreviation or clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. Prioritize the phrasing from the ""name"" column for consistency.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is a bit confusing, but I see the replacement table has three rows. Each row has a role (reactants, products, modifiers), an id, a name, and references. The equation seems to relate two ids: mw8a358487_b18b_42df_a646_cd75eb5bfcc2 and mwc844b7c0_98f5_4d0d_8f0c_00dfe8b54e6d.\n\nIn the replacement table, the first id (mw8a358487_b18b_42df_a646_cd75eb5bfcc2) appears in both reactants and modifiers, with the name NFkB and reference NFKB1. The second id (mwc844b7c0_98f5_4d0d_8f0c_00dfe8b54e6d) is a product, with the name TNF and reference TNF.\n\nSo, for each id, I need to map it to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start with the first id. The name is NFkB, and the reference is NFKB1. NFkB is a well-known transcription factor, so it\'s a single word. Since it\'s not a receptor or ligand, I don\'t need to add an underscore. The term is already clear, so I\'ll keep it as ""NFkB"".\n\nThe second id has the name TNF, and the reference is TNF as well. TNF is a cytokine, so it\'s a ligand. According to the guidelines, I should use the name from the ""name"" column if possible, so I\'ll go with ""TNF"". Since it\'s a ligand, maybe I should add ""_L"", but the guidelines say to use the name if it\'s reasonably interpretable. So perhaps ""TNF"" is sufficient, but I\'m a bit confused here. Wait, the guidelines mention that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, create a single word with an underscore. So maybe I should consider if TNF is a ligand.\n\nLooking back, the replacement table\'s ""name"" column says TNF, and the reference is TNF. So it\'s a ligand, right? So according to the guidelines, I should create a term like ""CSF1R_L"" for a ligand. So for TNF, I should add ""_L"". So the term would be ""TNF_L"". But wait, the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to make significant changes. TNF is an abbreviation, so perhaps it\'s better to leave it as TNF without adding ""_L"".\n\nI\'m a bit torn here. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s reasonably interpretable. Since TNF is a common abbreviation, maybe just ""TNF"" is acceptable without adding ""_L"". Alternatively, if I were to follow the receptor/ligand guideline, I might make it ""TNF_L"", but since the name is TNF, perhaps it\'s better to keep it as is.\n\nSo, for the first id, I\'ll map it to ""NFkB"". For the second id, I\'ll map it to ""TNF"". Therefore, the JSON object will have two keys: the first id mapped to ""NFkB"" and the second id mapped to ""TNF"".', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words. Also, if there\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". If the term is ambiguous, I should use context or references to make it more interpretable. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first map the id to the name, then refine it using references.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them as part of the term with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation and makes sense, I shouldn\'t change it much. For example, if the name is ""TNFa"", maybe it can stay as is, but if the reference says ""TNF"", perhaps I should use that for consistency.\n\nLooking at the replacement table provided, I see three entries:\n\n1. role: reactants, id: species_39, name: NFkB(nuc), reference: NFKB1\n2. role: products, id: species_24, name: TNFa, reference: TNF\n3. role: products, id: species_39, name: NFkB(nuc), reference: NFKB1\n4. role: modifiers, id: species_39, name: NFkB(nuc), reference: NFKB1\n\nWait, actually, species_39 appears in three roles: reactants, products, and modifiers. So I need to map each id to its term. But species_39 is the same in all three roles. So the JSON will have two keys: species_24 and species_39.\n\nFor species_24, the name is TNFa, and the reference is TNF. The guideline says to prioritize the name column for consistency, so maybe we use ""TNFa"". But the reference is ""TNF"", which is a common abbreviation. Hmm, but the user says to prioritize the name column. So I\'ll go with ""TNFa"".\n\nFor species_39, the name is NFkB(nuc) and the reference is NFKB1. The name is a bit ambiguous because it includes the location (nuc for nuclear). The guidelines suggest replacing ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones. So, perhaps I should expand NFkB(nuc) to something more descriptive. NFkB is a transcription factor, and when it\'s in the nucleus, it\'s active. So maybe ""NFkB_active"". Or perhaps ""NFkB_nuc_active"". But the user mentioned to include states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term. So maybe ""NFkB_active"".\n\nWait, but the replacement table has the same id for reactants, products, and modifiers. So in the JSON, species_39 would map to ""NFkB_active"" to indicate its state as active when it\'s a product or modifier. The reactant might be NFkB in the cytoplasm, but since the name is NFkB(nuc), perhaps it\'s already in the nucleus, so it\'s active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""species_24"": ""TNFa"",\n  ""species_39"": ""NFkB_active""\n}\n\nI think that\'s the right approach. I\'m using the name from the table but also considering the reference to make sure it\'s biologically accurate. I\'m making sure each term is a single word and using the underscore to indicate the state. Since species_39 appears in multiple roles, but the name is consistent, I can map it once.']","['NFkB => TNF; NFkB', 'NFkB_nuc => TNFa + NFkB_nuc; NFkB_nuc', 'NFkB => TNF; NFkB', 'NFkB(nuc) => TNFa + NFkB(nuc); NFkB(nuc)']","['mwbad3f510_fbca_4aa7_a4c2_5c1b47297802*NFkB^mw4d5fd70d_8603_4056_adfa_5af26d657455/(mw2fa0d3fe_4e99_49d2_a339_089198589a1e+NFkB^mw4d5fd70d_8603_4056_adfa_5af26d657455)', 'compartment_1*k1*NFkB_nuc^2', 'mwbad3f510_fbca_4aa7_a4c2_5c1b47297802*NFkB^mw4d5fd70d_8603_4056_adfa_5af26d657455/(mw2fa0d3fe_4e99_49d2_a339_089198589a1e+NFkB^mw4d5fd70d_8603_4056_adfa_5af26d657455)', 'compartment_1*k1*NFkB(nuc)^2']","[True, True, True, True]",22.0,16.77191343135492,3.370770972826082,8.0,1.2563207149505615,3.199559211514738,38.0,0.1568135917186737,2.3040310649784037,34.16666666666667,2.467553402843738,16.0,4

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nLooking at the example, they showed that ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So, if the `id` is ""R"" or ""L"", I need to connect it with the receptor or ligand name. But wait, in their replacement table, the `name` column might not always have the receptor or ligand, so I have to use context and references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the `id` to the `name` using the table, then refine it using references for accuracy. So, I need to look at both the `name` and `references` columns to make sure the term is correct.\n\nAnother point is about including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" as part of the term, connected with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". I should check if the term has such states and incorporate them.\n\nThe user also said to prioritize the `name` column\'s phrasing for consistency and clarity when synonyms are present in references. So, if the `name` and `references` have similar terms, I should stick with the `name`.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided:\n\nThe equation is ERK => aERK; aMEK.\n\nThe replacement table has three rows:\n\n1. role: reactants, id: ERK, name: ERK, references: MAPK3\n2. role: products, id: aERK, name: aERK, references: MAPK3\n3. role: modifiers, id: aMEK, name: aMEK, references: MAP2K1\n\nSo, for each `id`, I need to map it to a biologically interpretable term.\n\nStarting with ERK. The `name` is ERK, and the reference is MAPK3. ERK is a known abbreviation for extracellular signal-regulated kinase, which is indeed MAPK3. So, since ERK is a standard term and the reference confirms it, I can map id ""ERK"" to ""ERK"".\n\nNext, aERK. The `name` is aERK, which likely stands for activated ERK. The reference is MAPK3, same as ERK. So, ""aERK"" can be mapped to ""aERK"" since it\'s a specific term indicating the active form.\n\nLastly, aMEK. The `name` is aMEK, which stands for activated MEK. The reference is MAP2K1. MEK is mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and aMEK would be the active form. So, ""aMEK"" is the appropriate term here.\n\nI should make sure each term is a single word. ERK, aERK, and aMEK are all single words, so no need to combine further. Also, since the `name` column already provides clear terms, I don\'t need to make significant changes.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have keys as ""ERK"", ""aERK"", and ""aMEK"" with their respective values as the same terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and input to figure out the best way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the guidelines carefully. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to connect them with an underscore. But in this case, the terms don\'t seem to be receptors or ligands, so that part might not apply here. \n\nThe input includes an equation: ERK1 => pERK1; ppMEK1. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s look at each one.\n\nStarting with the first row: role is reactants, id is ERK1, name is empty, and reference is MAPK3. Since the name is empty, I should probably use the reference. MAPK3 is a known term, so ERK1 maps to MAPK3. But since ERK1 is an abbreviation, maybe it\'s better to keep it as ERK1? But the guideline says if it\'s an abbreviation, it\'s not recommended to change it significantly. So I\'ll map ERK1 to ERK1.\n\nNext, the second row: role is products, id is pERK1, name is empty, reference is MOD%3A00048 and MAPK3. The MOD references are identifiers, but the name is empty. Since the id is pERK1, which stands for phosphorylated ERK1, maybe I should map it to pERK1. But the guideline suggests using the name if available, but here it\'s empty. So perhaps I should keep it as pERK1. Alternatively, using MAPK3 might be more accurate, but the user\'s example used the id directly when the name was empty. Hmm, but in the example, the id was R or L, which were mapped to specific receptors. Here, the id is pERK1, so maybe it\'s better to use the id as the term since the name is missing.\n\nThe third row: role is modifiers, id is ppMEK1, name is empty, references include MOD%3A00048, MOD%3A00047, and MAP2K1. So the id is ppMEK1, which stands for phosphorylated MEK1. The reference is MAP2K1, which is the full name for MEK1. But again, the name is empty, so I might stick with ppMEK1. Alternatively, using MAP2K1 could be more precise, but the user\'s example used the id when the name was empty. I think ppMEK1 is the correct term here.\n\nWait, but looking back at the example in the guidelines, when the name was empty, the id was used directly. So I think that\'s the right approach here. Therefore, ERK1 maps to ERK1, pERK1 maps to pERK1, and ppMEK1 maps to ppMEK1.\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word. All the ids are already single words, so no issues there. There\'s no mention of states like ""bound"" or ""active,"" so I don\'t need to add those. Also, since the names are empty, I don\'t need to make any substitutions based on them.\n\nSo, compiling the JSON, the keys are ERK1, pERK1, and ppMEK1, each mapping to themselves as the biologically interpretable terms. I think that\'s the correct approach based on the guidelines provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

That means I can\'t have multiple words; I need to combine terms if necessary. If the term is an abbreviation or already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much. But if it\'s ambiguous, I should replace it with a more specific term using the replacement table.\n\nThe example they gave was for ""R"" and ""L"", where they connected the ligand and receptor with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to look for such cases where the term is a receptor or ligand and combine them accordingly.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first, map the `id` to the `name` using the replacement table, and then refine it using references. I should check if the `name` and `references` columns have synonyms and prioritize the `name` for consistency.\n\nThe equation provided is ERK_ppMEKc_obs = ERK_ppMEKc. The replacement table has one entry where the `id` is ERK_ppMEKc_obs and the `name` is ERK_ppMEKc, with references MAPK3 and MAP2K1. \n\nLooking at this, ERK_ppMEKc_obs seems to be an observed form of ERK bound to phosphorylated MEK. The references point to MAPK3 and MAP2K1, which are ERK and MEK respectively. So, the term should be a single word, combining ERK and the bound state with phosphorylated MEK.\n\nFollowing the guidelines, I should consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. So, ERK_bound_to_pMEKc would make sense, where ""bound"" indicates the interaction and ""pMEKc"" stands for phosphorylated MEK catalytic subunit.\n\nI don\'t see any need for further changes since the term is already specific and clear. It\'s a single word, combines the receptor and ligand context, and includes the state. So, the JSON should map ERK_ppMEKc_obs to ERK_bound_to_pMEKc.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

For example, if the `id` is ""ERK"", I first look at the `name` which is ""ERK"", then check the references which say ""MAPK3"". So, maybe I should use ""MAPK3"" as the term instead.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, joined with an underscore. For example, ""IL6_R_active"". So, if the `id` or `name` suggests a state, I should add that.\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided:\n\nEquation: ERK => aERK; aMEK\n\nReplacement Table:\n\n| role      | id   | name   | references   |\n|:----------|:-----|:-------|:-------------|\n| reactants | ERK  | ERK    | MAPK3        |\n| products  | aERK | aERK   | MAPK3        |\n| modifiers | aMEK | aMEK   | MAP2K1       |\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` (ERK, aERK, aMEK) to their biologically interpretable terms.\n\nStarting with ERK:\n\n- `id`: ERK\n- `name`: ERK\n- `references`: MAPK3\n\nSince the reference is MAPK3, which is a known name for ERK, I should use MAPK3 as the term. So, ERK maps to MAPK3.\n\nNext, aERK:\n\n- `id`: aERK\n- `name`: aERK\n- `references`: MAPK3\n\nThe \'a\' in aERK likely stands for \'active\'. So, combining the state \'active\' with the name, it would be MAPK3_active. So, aERK maps to MAPK3_active.\n\nLastly, aMEK:\n\n- `id`: aMEK\n- `name`: aMEK\n- `references`: MAP2K1\n\nSimilarly, \'a\' in aMEK is \'active\'. So, the term would be MAP2K1_active. So, aMEK maps to MAP2K1_active.\n\nI should make sure these are single words, which they are. I don\'t see any need for underscores unless combining receptor/ligand, which isn\'t the case here. Also, since the references give the specific names, I should prioritize those over the `id` or `name` unless the `name` is more consistent.\n\nWait, the guidelines say to prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column if references have synonyms. But in this case, the `name` is the same as `id` (ERK, aERK, aMEK), but the references provide the specific gene names. So, it\'s better to use the gene names for clarity and specificity.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each `id` to the gene name with the state if applicable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. The replacement table has an `id`, `name`, and `references` column. I should prioritize the `name` column for consistency unless the `references` provide a better term.\n\nLooking at the input equation: pERKc is converted to pERK_ppMEKc, and there are several modifiers involved. The replacement table lists several `id`s with their names and references.\n\nStarting with `pERKc`. The `name` is the same as the `id`, and the reference is MAPK3, which I know is also called ERK. Since it\'s a single word and already specific, I don\'t need to change it. So, `pERKc` maps to ""pERKc"".\n\nNext, `pERK_ppMEKc`. The name is the same as the id, and the references are MAPK3 and MAP2K1. MAPK3 is ERK, and MAP2K1 is MEK. So, the term combines both, indicating a complex or interaction between ERK and MEK. So, I\'ll map it to ""ERK_ppMEKc"".\n\nThen, `ppMEKc_tot`. The `name` is the same as `id`, and the reference is MAP2K1, which is MEK. The term ends with ""_tot"", indicating total. So, it\'s the total form of ppMEKc. I\'ll map it to ""ppMEKc_tot"".\n\nNext is `ERK_ppMEKc`. The name is the same as `id`, references are MAPK3 and MAP2K1. Similar to the previous one, it\'s ERK interacting with MEK. So, ""ERK_ppMEKc"" is the term.\n\nNow, looking at all the modifiers, some of them are duplicates. For example, `pERKc` appears again, so I already have that mapped. Same with `ppMEKc_tot`.\n\nPutting it all together, each unique `id` is mapped based on their `name` or the references, ensuring they\'re biologically accurate and single words. I need to make sure there are no explanations, just the JSON object.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

That means if there\'s a compound term like a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But sometimes, the receptor or ligand names aren\'t directly in the ""name"" column, so I\'ll need to use context and references to figure that out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. First, map the `id` to the `name`, and then refine it using the references for accuracy. That makes sense because sometimes the `name` might be an abbreviation or not specific enough.\n\nIncluding states like ""bound"" or ""active"" is important, so I should join those with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already clear as-is, like a straightforward abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much. Consistency is key, so I should prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column over the references when possible.\n\nNow, looking at the input they provided. The equation is ERK_ppMEKc => pERKc; ERK_ppMEKc. The replacement table has three rows:\n\n1. reactants | ERK_ppMEKc | ERK_ppMEKc | MAPK3; MAP2K1\n2. products | pERKc | pERKc | MAPK3\n3. modifiers | ERK_ppMEKc | ERK_ppMEKc | MAPK3; MAP2K1\n\nI need to map each `id` to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s take each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: id is ERK_ppMEKc. The name is the same, ERK_ppMEKc. The references are MAPK3 and MAP2K1. MAPK3 is ERK1, and MAP2K1 is MEK1. So ERK_ppMEKc probably refers to ERK being phosphorylated by MEK. Since both are proteins, I can represent this as ERK_MEKc. The ""c"" likely stands for catalytic or something similar, but in this context, it\'s probably part of the term, so I\'ll keep it.\n\nSecond row: id is pERKc. The name is pERKc, and the reference is MAPK3, which is ERK1. So pERKc is already a standard abbreviation for phosphorylated ERK. Since it\'s a single word and clear, I don\'t need to change it.\n\nThird row: same as the first row, id ERK_ppMEKc, so the same term applies here. It\'s a modifier, but the term remains ERK_MEKc.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term. So ERK_ppMEKc becomes ERK_MEKc, and pERKc remains pERKc.\n\nI think that covers it. I\'ll make sure the JSON is properly formatted with each id as the key and the corresponding term as the value, without any additional comments or explanations.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: pERK1 => ppERK1; ppMEK1. The replacement table has three rows with roles as reactants, products, and modifiers, each with their own IDs, names, and references.\n\nStarting with pERK1. The role is reactant, id is pERK1, name is empty, and references are MOD identifiers and MAPK3. I know that pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK, which is a kinase. MAPK3 is the name here, so pERK1 should map to MAPK3 in a phosphorylated state. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s in an active state. So I\'ll go with ""MAPK3_active"".\n\nNext, ppERK1 is a product. The name is empty, but references include MOD identifiers and MAPK3 again. The double phosphorylation suggests it\'s fully activated. So, similar to pERK1, but since it\'s a product, it\'s more active. I\'ll use ""MAPK3_active"" again because it\'s the same protein, just a different phosphorylation state.\n\nLastly, ppMEK1 is a modifier. The name is empty, and references include MOD identifiers and MAP2K1. MEK stands for Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase, and MAP2K1 is the specific name. The double phosphorylation indicates it\'s active. So, I\'ll map this to ""MAP2K1_active"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word. For receptors and ligands, I have to connect them with underscores, but in this case, all the terms are kinases with states, so using underscores for the state makes sense.\n\nI should check if any of these need to be more specific. For example, if ""pERK1"" is part of a receptor-ligand pair, I might need to connect them, but the references don\'t indicate that.

The references for ""pERK_ppMEKc"" are MAPK3 and MAP2K1, while ""ppERKc"" references MAPK3. \n\nSince the `name` column already has the terms as they are, and the references don\'t suggest a simpler or more interpretable term, I don\'t need to change them.

The replacement table has several rows with ids like ERK, Mek_active, ERK_active, and Mek_active, each pointing to their respective references like MAPK3 and MAP2K1.\n\nSo, for each id, I need to map it to a single word. Let\'s go through each id:\n\n1. ERK: The name is ERK, reference is MAPK3. Since ERK is a common abbreviation and biologically interpretable, I\'ll map it to ""ERK"".\n\n2. Mek_active: The name is Mek_active, reference is MAP2K1. Mek is an abbreviation for MAPK/ERK kinase, so Mek_active is a specific state, so I\'ll keep it as ""Mek_active"".\n\n3.

Let\'s take each row one by one.\n\nFirst row: id is ERK_ppMEKc. The name is the same, ERK_ppMEKc. The references are MAPK3 and MAP2K1. MAPK3 is ERK1, and MAP2K1 is MEK1. So ERK_ppMEKc probably refers to ERK being phosphorylated by MEK. Since both are proteins, I can represent this as ERK_MEKc. The ""c"" likely stands for catalytic or something similar, but in this context, it\'s probably part of the term, so I\'ll keep it.\n\nSecond row: id is pERKc. The name is pERKc, and the reference is MAPK3, which is ERK1. So pERKc is already a standard abbreviation for phosphorylated ERK. Since it\'s a single word and clear, I don\'t need to change it.\n\nThird row: same as the first row, id ERK_ppMEKc, so the same term applies here. It\'s a modifier, but the term remains ERK_MEKc.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its term.

The references for ""pERK_ppMEKc"" are MAPK3 and MAP2K1, while ""ppERKc"" references MAPK3. \n\nSince the `name` column already has the terms as they are, and the references don\'t suggest a simpler or more interpretable term, I don\'t need to change them.

The first row is for reactants, with id ERK1 and references to MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00047, which I think are identifiers for the MEK and ERK proteins. The second row is for products, pERK1, which also references MOD%3A00048 and MAPK3. The third row is for modifiers, ppMEK1, referencing MOD%3A00048, MOD%3A00047, and MAP2K1.\n\nI need to map each id (ERK1, pERK1, ppMEK1) to a term. Let\'s start with ERK1. The name column is empty, but the reference is MAPK3. MAPK3 is the gene name for ERK1. Since it\'s a single word and already interpretable, I don\'t need to change it.

The replacement table lists several `id`s with their names and references.\n\nStarting with `pERKc`. The `name` is the same as the `id`, and the reference is MAPK3, which I know is also called ERK.

The name is the same as the id, and the references are MAPK3 and MAP2K1. MAPK3 is ERK, and MAP2K1 is MEK. So, the term combines both, indicating a complex or interaction between ERK and MEK. So, I\'ll map it to ""ERK_ppMEKc"".\n\nThen, `ppMEKc_tot`. The `name` is the same as `id`, and the reference is MAP2K1, which is MEK. The term ends with ""_tot"", indicating total.

Similar to the previous one, it\'s ERK interacting with MEK. So, ""ERK_ppMEKc"" is the term.\n\nNow, looking at all the modifiers, some of them are duplicates. For example, `pERKc` appears again, so I already have that mapped.

The references point to CHEBI_28910, which I think is the ChEBI ID for Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. Since PIP2 is a common abbreviation, and it\'s already a single word, I can keep it as is. So P2 maps to ""PIP2"".\n\nNext, P3 is PIP3.

So P3 maps to ""PIP3"".\n\nfint is a modifier, and its name is fint. Since there\'s no reference, and it\'s an abbreviation, I\'ll leave it as ""fint"".\n\nE11P: The name is E11_p.

To make it biologically interpretable, I can write it as ""EGFR_p"".\n\nE12P: The name is E12_p, and the reference is EGFR and ERBB2. So this is another phosphorylated form, possibly of ERBB2. Since both EGFR and ERBB2 are HER family receptors, but the name is E12_p, perhaps it\'s best to stick with ""EGFR_p"" as well, unless I have more context.

So perhaps for E12P, the name is E12_p, but the reference includes EGFR and ERBB2. Maybe E12_p is a phosphorylated form of EGFR, so I\'ll go with ""EGFR_p"".\n\nE23P: The name is E23_p, and the references are empty.

Alternatively, since the name is ""Sum PI-3K"", perhaps it\'s better to write it as ""PI_3K_sum"".\n\nAlternatively, maybe ""SigI"" stands for something else.

Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. SigS maps to ""Sum Shc"". Since it\'s a reactant, and the name is ""Sum Shc"", I should probably keep it as is unless there\'s a more specific term. The reference column is empty, so I\'ll go with ""Sum_Shc"".\n\n2. SigSP maps to ""Sum Shc_p"". The ""p"" likely stands for phosphorylated. So, it should be ""Sum_Shc_p"".\n\n3. E11P maps to ""E11_p"" with a reference to EGFR. Since it\'s a modifier, and the name is ""E11_p"", maybe I should look at the reference. EGFR is a receptor, so perhaps E11 is part of EGFR. But the name is E11_p, so I\'ll use ""EGFR_p"".\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if the name is reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it much. So maybe I should stick with ""E11_p"" as the term. But the reference is EGFR, so maybe it\'s better to use the more specific term. Hmm, but the name is E11_p, so perhaps it\'s a specific form. I think I\'ll go with ""E11_p"" unless I have more context.\n\n4. E12P maps to ""E12_p"" with references to EGFR and ERBB2. Since both are receptors, maybe it\'s a heterodimer. But the name is E12_p, so perhaps I should use ""EGFR_ERBB2_p"" to reflect both references.\n\n5. E23P is ""E23_p"" with no references. So I\'ll keep it as ""E23_p"".\n\n6. E24P is ""E24_p"" with no references. So ""E24_p"".\n\n7. E34P is ""E34_p"" with no references. So ""E34_p"".\n\n8. E44P is ""E44_p"" with no references. So ""E44_p"".\n\n9. E13P is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"" with no references. So I\'ll keep it as ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"".\n\n10. E14P is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"" same as E13P.\n\n11. SigT maps to ""Sig-PTP-1B"". That seems like a specific term, so I\'ll use ""Sig_PTP_1B"".\n\nWait, the guidelines say that if a term is a simple abbreviation or reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it. So for SigT, ""Sig-PTP-1B"" is already a term, but maybe it\'s better to write it as a single word with underscores. So ""Sig_PTP_1B"".\n\nPutting it all together, I\'ll map each id to its name, ensuring they are single words with underscores where necessary. For modifiers with references, I might use the more specific terms if possible, but in most cases, the names are already specific enough.\n\nSo the JSON would look like:\n\n{\n  ""SigS"": ""Sum_Shc"",\n  ""SigSP"": ""Sum_Shc_p"",\n  ""E11P"": ""E11_p"",\n  ""E12P"": ""EGFR_ERBB2_p"",\n  ""E23P"": ""E23_p"",\n  ""E24P"": ""E24_p"",\n  ""E34P"": ""E34_p"",\n  ""E44P"": ""E44_p"",\n  ""E13P"": ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"",\n  ""E14P"": ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"",\n  ""SigT"": ""Sig_PTP_1B""\n}\n\nWait, for E12P, I thought about using ""EGFR_ERBB2_p"" because the references are EGFR and ERBB2. But the name is ""E12_p"", so maybe it\'s better to keep it as ""E12_p"" unless there\'s a specific reason to change it. Similarly, E13P and E14P have the same name, so they map to the same term.\n\nI think that\'s a reasonable approach. I\'ll proceed with this mapping.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, the input includes an equation: SigR => SigRP; E11P, E12P, E23P, E24P, E34P, E44P, E13P, E14P, SigT. Each of these IDs needs to be mapped to a term.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, each ID has a corresponding name and sometimes references. My task is to convert each ID into a single word term that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nStarting with SigR: The name is ""Sum RasGAP"". Since it\'s a simple name, I\'ll keep it as SigR.\n\nSigRP: The name is ""Sum RasGAP_p"". The ""_p"" likely stands for phosphorylated, so I\'ll map it to SigRP_p.\n\nNow, looking at the modifiers: E11P, E12P, etc. Each has a name like E11_p, E12_p, etc. The references for E11P are EGFR, and E12P has EGFR and ERBB2. The guidelines say to use context from references if needed.\n\nFor E11P, the name is E11_p, and the reference is EGFR. Since EGFR is a receptor, maybe E11 is a part of EGFR. But the guidelines suggest if it\'s a receptor or ligand, we should connect them with an underscore. However, since the name is E11_p and the reference is EGFR, perhaps the term should be EGFR_p. But wait, the guidelines also say if the name is reasonably interpretable, we shouldn\'t change it much. So maybe E11P should just be E11_p, but the reference suggests it\'s related to EGFR. Hmm, but the name is already E11_p, so maybe we just use that.\n\nSimilarly, E12P has the name E12_p and references EGFR and ERBB2. Since it\'s a modifier, perhaps it\'s a part of the EGFR pathway. But without more context, I think the name E12_p is sufficient.\n\nE23P, E24P, E34P, E44P all have names ending with _p but no references, so I\'ll map them directly to E23_p, E24_p, etc.\n\nE13P and E14P have the name ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"". According to the guidelines, if a receptor and ligand can be identified, we connect them with an underscore. Here, it\'s a dimer of ErbB1 and ErbB3, so I should represent it as ErbB1_ErbB3_p.\n\nSigT has the name ""Sig-PTP-1B"". Since it\'s a single term, I\'ll keep it as SigT.\n\nWait, but for E13P and E14P, the name is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"", but the guidelines suggest using underscores. So should I change it to ErbB1_ErbB3_p? Yes, that makes it a single word with an underscore, which fits the requirement.\n\nSo compiling all this:\n\nSigR: Sum_RasGAP\nSigRP: Sum_RasGAP_p\nE11P: EGFR_p (but the name is E11_p, but reference is EGFR. Do I use the name or the reference? Guidelines say to prioritize the name, so E11_p)\nE12P: E12_p (references include EGFR and ERBB2, but name is E12_p, so keep as E12_p)\nE23P: E23_p\nE24P: E24_p\nE34P: E34_p\nE44P: E44_p\nE13P: ErbB1_ErbB3_p\nE14P: ErbB1_ErbB3_p\nSigT: Sig_PTP_1B\n\nWait, but for SigT, the name is ""Sig-PTP-1B"". Should I replace the hyphens with underscores? The guidelines say to use single words, so maybe Sig_PTP_1B. But the example given used underscores, like IL6_R, so yes.\n\nSo the JSON should map each id to the corresponding term.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the replacement table. It has four columns: role, id, name, and references. The role column seems to indicate whether each id is a reactant, product, or modifier. The name column gives a more descriptive term for each id, and the references provide additional context or related terms.\n\nThe main task is to map each id to a single-word term that\'s biologically meaningful. The guidelines mention that if the name is a simple abbreviation or already interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much. However, if there\'s ambiguity, I should use the references to make it more specific.\n\nLooking at the equation provided: SigA => SigAP; E11P, E12P, E23P, E24P, E34P, E44P, E13P, E14P, SigT\n\nI need to process each id in the replacement table:\n\n1. SigA: The name is ""Sum Gab1"". Since it\'s a reactant, and the name is a bit generic, maybe I should look at references. But there are no references for SigA, so perhaps it\'s best to keep it as ""Sum_Gab1"" to make it a single word.\n\n2. SigAP: The name is ""Sum Gab1_p"". This indicates a phosphorylated state. So I can combine them as ""Sum_Gab1_p"".\n\n3. E11P: The name is ""E11_p"" and the reference is EGFR. So E11 is a part of EGFR. Maybe it\'s better to use the receptor name with the modifier. Since E11 is a part of EGFR, perhaps ""EGFR_E11_p"".\n\n4. E12P: The name is ""E12_p"" and the reference is EGFR and ERBB2. This is a bit ambiguous. Since both EGFR and ERBB2 are involved, maybe ""EGFR_ERBB2_E12_p"" to include both receptors.\n\n5. E23P: The name is ""E23_p"" with no references. Since there\'s no additional context, perhaps just ""E23_p"".\n\n6. E24P: Similarly, ""E24_p"" with no references, so keep it as ""E24_p"".\n\n7. E34P: ""E34_p"" with no references, so ""E34_p"".\n\n8. E44P: ""E44_p"" with no references, so ""E44_p"".\n\n9. E13P: The name is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"". This seems specific, so I\'ll use ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"".\n\n10. E14P: Same as E13P, so ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"".\n\n11. SigT: The name is ""Sig-PTP-1B"". This can be combined as ""Sig_PTP1B"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'ll join the parts with underscores. Also, for E12P, since it\'s referenced to both EGFR and ERBB2, I included both to make it clear. For SigA and SigAP, I kept the abbreviation with the full name connected by an underscore. For E13P and E14P, I used the receptor names directly.\n\nI think that covers all the ids. Now, I\'ll structure this into a JSON object with each id as the key and the corresponding term as the value.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the replacement table. It has four columns: role, id, name, and references. The role column seems to indicate whether each id is a reactant, product, or modifier. The name column gives a more descriptive term for each id, and the references provide additional context or related terms.\n\nThe equation provided is: SigA => SigAP; E11P, E12P, E23P, E24P, E34P, E44P, E13P, E14P, SigT\n\nThis looks like a reaction where SigA is converted to SigAP, and the modifiers are the other terms listed after the semicolon.\n\nNow, I need to process each id in the replacement table. Let\'s go through them one by one.\n\n1. **SigA**: The name is ""Sum Gab1"". Since this is a reactant, and there\'s no reference, I should use the name as is. So, the term is ""Sum_Gab1"".\n\n2. **SigAP**: The name is ""Sum Gab1_p"". This is a product, so it\'s a phosphorylated form. The term becomes ""Sum_Gab1_p"".\n\n3. **E11P**: The name is ""E11_p"", and the reference is EGFR. Since E11P is a modifier, I should consider the reference. EGFR is a receptor, so combining the name with the receptor gives ""EGFR_p"".\n\n4. **E12P**: The name is ""E12_p"", and the reference is EGFR; ERBB2. Since both are receptors, I need to represent both. So, it becomes ""EGFR_ERBB2_p"".\n\n5. **E23P**: The name is ""E23_p"", and there are no references. So, it remains ""E23_p"".\n\n6. **E24P**: The name is ""E23_p"" (Wait, no, looking back, E24P\'s name is ""E24_p""). No references, so it\'s ""E24_p"".\n\n7. **E34P**: The name is ""E34_p"", no references, so it stays as ""E34_p"".\n\n8. **E44P**: The name is ""E44_p"", no references, so it\'s ""E44_p"".\n\n9. **E13P**: The name is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"", no references. Since these are receptors, I\'ll keep it as ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"".\n\n10. **E14P**: Same as E13P, name is ""ErbB1-ErbB3_p"", so ""ErbB1_ErbB3_p"".\n\n11. **SigT**: The name is ""Sig-PTP-1B"". PTP-1B is a phosphatase, so the term becomes ""Sig_PTP1B"".\n\nI need to ensure that each term is a single word, using underscores to combine parts. I also need to check if any terms can be more specific, like using the receptor name instead of a generic term. For example, E11P\'s reference is EGFR, so I use ""EGFR_p"" instead of just ""E11_p"".\n\nWait, in the case of E12P, the references are EGFR and ERBB2. Since both are involved, I combine them with an underscore: ""EGFR_ERBB2_p"".\n\nFor SigT, ""Sig-PTP-1B"" should be written as ""Sig_PTP1B"" to make it a single word.\n\nI think I\'ve covered all the ids.

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and input to figure out the best way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the guidelines carefully. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"". But if the term is already clear, like an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input, the equation is ERK2 => pERK2; ppMEK2. So, the replacements are ERK2, pERK2, and ppMEK2. The replacement table has details for each id, including their names and references.\n\nStarting with ERK2: The role is reactants, id is ERK2, name is empty, and references point to MAPK1. Since the name is empty, I need to rely on the references. MAPK1 is a known synonym for ERK2, so ERK2 should map to MAPK1. But since it\'s an abbreviation, maybe I don\'t need to change it, so it\'s just ""ERK2"".\n\nNext, pERK2: The role is products, id is pERK2, name is also empty, but references include MOD identifiers and MAPK1. So pERK2 is a phosphorylated form of ERK2, which is MAPK1. So the term should be ""pERK2"".\n\nThen, ppMEK2: The role is modifiers, id is ppMEK2, name is empty, references are MAP2K2 and MOD identifiers. MAP2K2 is another name for MEK2. The pp in ppMEK2 likely stands for phosphorylated, so it\'s ""ppMEK2"".\n\nI think I should map each id to their respective names, considering the references. Since the names are empty, I use the references. So ERK2 maps to MAPK1, but since it\'s an abbreviation, I leave it as ERK2. Similarly, pERK2 and ppMEK2 are already specific, so they stay as is.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the name is not in the name column, use context and references. So for ERK2, since the reference is MAPK1, maybe I should map ERK2 to MAPK1. But ERK2 is a well-known abbreviation, so perhaps keeping it as ERK2 is better for clarity. The same goes for ppMEK2 and pERK2.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON would map each id to their respective terms without further modification because they\'re already biologically interpretable as single words.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The replacement table has three rows with roles as reactants, products, and modifiers, each with their own IDs and references.\n\nStarting with pERK2. The role is reactant, id is pERK2, name is empty, and references point to MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00048 again, and MAPK1. Wait, MOD%3A00048 is a model ID, but the actual biological term is MAPK1, which I know is also called ERK2. So pERK2 stands for phosphorylated ERK2. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s the active form? Or perhaps just the phosphorylated state. The guidelines say to include states like ""active"" or ""bound"" if present. But here, pERK2 is the phosphorylated form, so maybe we can just use ""pERK2"" as it\'s already interpretable.\n\nNext is ppERK2, a product. The references again include MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00047, and MAPK1. Wait, MOD%3A00047 is another model ID, but the name is still empty. ppERK2 would be doubly phosphorylated ERK2, which is the active form. So perhaps we should denote it as ""ppERK2_active"" to show it\'s active. But the guidelines mention using the name column if possible, but here the name is empty. So I think using ""ppERK2"" is sufficient unless there\'s a state to include. Since the equation shows it\'s a product, maybe it\'s active, so I could add ""_active"".\n\nLastly, ppMEK2. The role is modifier, id is ppMEK2, name is empty, references include MAP2K2 and two MOD IDs. MAP2K2 is MEK2, and ppMEK2 would be phosphorylated MEK2. Since it\'s a modifier, maybe it\'s the active form as well. So ppMEK2 could be ""ppMEK2_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So maybe just keeping them as pERK2, ppERK2, and ppMEK2 is enough. The references don\'t provide additional states explicitly, so perhaps I shouldn\'t assume the states unless the name or references indicate it.\n\nLooking back, the replacement table doesn\'t have any explicit states in the name or references, so I think the safest approach is to map them directly. So pERK2 stays as ""pERK2"", ppERK2 as ""ppERK2"", and ppMEK2 as ""ppMEK2"". \n\nI should also consider if any of these are receptors or ligands. From the equation, it\'s a phosphorylation reaction, so they are probably kinases, not receptors or ligands. So no need to combine with underscores.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have each id as the key and the term as the value without additional modifications.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

So I need to map ERK2 to MAPK1. Since ERK2 is a kinase, maybe it\'s better to use the full name for clarity, but the guidelines say if it\'s an abbreviation, we can leave it as is. However, since the reference provides MAPK1, I should use that instead of ERK2.\n\nNext, pERK2 has references to MOD identifiers and MAPK1. So pERK2 is the phosphorylated form of ERK2, which is MAPK1. So the term would be pMAPK1 because it\'s the phosphorylated state. I\'m combining \'p\' with the full term for clarity.\n\nThen, ppMEK2. The references include MAP2K2 and MOD identifiers. MEK2 is a kinase, and ppMEK2 likely refers to the doubly phosphorylated form. So the term would be ppMAP2K2, combining \'pp\' with the full name.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the name is empty, use the reference. So ERK2 should map to MAPK1, which is the name from the reference. Similarly, pERK2 maps to pMAPK1, and ppMEK2 maps to ppMAP2K2.\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'m just appending the state (p for phosphorylated, pp for doubly phosphorylated) to the respective kinase names. No underscores needed since they are states, not receptor-ligand pairs.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its corresponding term as I figured out.

Let me start by understanding the guidelines.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any R or L, so maybe that doesn\'t apply here.\n\nNext, I should consider if any terms need a two-step process. That means first mapping the `id` to the `name` and then refining it using the references. Let me check each `id` one by one.\n\nStarting with species_13: the name is P90RskInactive, and the references mention p90 S6 kinase and RPS6KA1. So, I need to find a biologically accurate term. P90Rsk is known as p90 ribosomal S6 kinase. The term is already pretty specific, but since it\'s inactive, maybe I should include that state. So, it would be P90Rsk_inactive.\n\nFor species_12: the name is P90RskActive, references are the same. Following the same logic, it should be P90Rsk_active.\n\nThen, species_10: the name is ErkActive, and the references are MAPK1 and MAPK3. ERK is a well-known term, so ErkActive can stay as is, but to be more precise, since the references specify MAPK1 and MAPK3, but the name is ErkActive, it\'s better to keep it as Erk_active for consistency with the name column.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say if the name is simple and interpretable, don\'t change it much. So maybe ErkActive is fine, but adding the state with an underscore makes it clearer. So I\'ll go with Erk_active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have species_13 mapped to P90Rsk_inactive, species_12 to P90Rsk_active, and species_10 to Erk_active.\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines.

Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nThe input equation is s195 + s198 => s196. So, we have two reactants, s195 and s198, which produce a product, s196.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For s195, the name is NFkB, and the references are NFKB1 and RELA. I know that NFkB is a common abbreviation for nuclear factor kappa B, which is a protein complex. The references NFKB1 and RELA are genes that encode parts of this complex. So, NFkB is a well-known term, so I can keep it as is.\n\n- For s198, the name is Promp105:RNAP. I\'m not sure what Promp105 refers to. RNAP is probably RNA polymerase. Maybe Promp105 is a specific form or modification of RNA polymerase. Since the name is already a combination, I can use it directly unless I have more info, but the references are empty, so I\'ll keep it as Promp105_RNAP.\n\n- For s196, the name is Promp105:RNAP1:p50p65. So this seems like a complex of Promp105, RNAP1, and the proteins p50 and p65. In biology, NFkB is often composed of p50 and p65 subunits. So maybe this is the active form of NFkB bound to RNA polymerase. Since the name is specific, I\'ll use it as Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example used underscores to combine terms. So I should ensure that each term is a single word, connected with underscores if necessary. So for s198, it\'s Promp105_RNAP, and for s196, it\'s Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65.\n\nI should also consider if any of these terms are ambiguous. For example, s195 is NFkB, which is commonly used, so no changes needed. s198 and s196 are specific names, so they should be kept as single words with underscores.\n\nI don\'t see any need to add states like ""active"" or ""bound"" unless the name suggests it. In s196, the presence of p50p65 indicates the NFkB complex, which is active, but since the name doesn\'t include ""active,"" I\'ll stick with the given terms.\n\nSo the JSON should map each id to its corresponding term as follows:\n\ns195: NFkB\ns198: Promp105_RNAP\ns196: Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check each term to make sure they\'re biologically accurate. NFkB is correct, Promp105 seems specific, and the combination with RNAP1 and the subunits makes sense for the product.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: s199 + s195 => s200. Each of these ids (s199, s195, s200) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For s199, the name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"". Hmm, I\'m not entirely sure what each part stands for. ""RNAP"" likely stands for RNA Polymerase. ""FTAX"" could be an abbreviation, maybe for a specific subunit or a complex. ""Promp105"" might be a promoter element. So, putting it together, this seems to be a complex involving RNA Polymerase and perhaps other factors. Maybe it\'s a transcription initiation complex.\n\n- For s195, the name is ""NFkB"". NF-kB is a well-known transcription factor. The references mention NFKB1 and RELA, which are subunits of the NF-kB complex. So, NF-kB is composed of proteins like p50 (from NFKB1) and p65 (RELA). So, s195 should be mapped to NFkB.\n\n- For s200, the name is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". This looks like a combination of the previous components plus p50 and p65, which are parts of NF-kB. So, this might be the active form of the transcription initiation complex, including the NF-kB subunits.\n\nNow, following the guidelines:\n\n- Each term should be a single word. So, I need to combine parts with underscores if necessary.\n\n- If there\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. But in this case, all are transcription factors or complexes, so maybe not applicable.\n\n- If there\'s a state like active or bound, include it as part of the term. For s200, since it includes p50p65, which are active subunits, maybe we should denote it as active.\n\n- If the term is already interpretable, don\'t change it much. For s195, ""NFkB"" is standard, so we can leave it as is.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- s199: The name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"". Since it\'s a complex, perhaps we can denote it as RNAP bound to promoter elements. Maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"" or something like that. But the guidelines say to make it a single word, so underscores are allowed. Alternatively, since ""RNAP:FTAX"" might be part of the holoenzyme, maybe ""RNAP_holoenzyme"". But without more context, it\'s safer to use the parts as given. So, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"".\n\n- s195: ""NFkB"" is straightforward, so map to ""NFkB"".\n\n- s200: The name is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". This seems to be the active form of the complex with NF-kB bound. So, perhaps ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"" or ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_p50p65_active"". But considering the references, since p50 and p65 are parts of NF-kB, it\'s better to use NFkB. So, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is reasonably interpretable, don\'t change it. The names in the replacement table are already somewhat technical. So perhaps for s199, we can use ""RNAP_holoenzyme"" or ""RNAP_bound"" if it\'s bound to the promoter. Alternatively, since the name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"", maybe it\'s the RNA Polymerase II holoenzyme bound to the promoter, so ""RNAP2_holoenzyme_bound"".\n\nBut without more context, it\'s hard to be precise. The safest approach is to use the name as is, replacing colons with underscores. So s199 becomes ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"", s195 is ""NFkB"", and s200 is ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_p50p65"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to use the name column unless necessary, and the references can help. For s195, the references are NFKB1 and RELA, which are subunits of NF-kB. So the name is already NFkB, which is correct.\n\nFor s200, the name includes p50p65, which are parts of NF-kB, so maybe we can denote it as the active form, hence ""active"". So perhaps ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nBut the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so combining parts with underscores. So for s199, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"".\n\nSimilarly, s200 would be ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nAlternatively, if s200 is the product, which is the active form, we can include ""active"" in the term.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n{\n  ""s199"": ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"",\n  ""s195"": ""NFkB"",\n  ""s200"": ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure if ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"" is the best term. Maybe ""RNAP_bound_Promp105_FTAX"" or ""RNAP_holoenzyme"". Alternatively, perhaps ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_bound"" to indicate it\'s bound to the promoter.\n\nWait, the guidelines mention including states like bound or active. So for s199, since it\'s the reactant, it\'s likely in a bound state. So maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_bound"".\n\nSimilarly, s200 is the product, which is the active form, so ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nBut I\'m not entirely certain. Maybe I should keep it simpler and just use the name with underscores.\n\nSo, final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""s199"": ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"",\n  ""s195"": ""NFkB"",\n  ""s200"": ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB_active""\n}\n\nAlternatively, since s200 has p50p65, which are parts of NF-kB, perhaps it\'s better to denote it as ""NFkB_active"" in the term.\n\nWait, the name for s200 is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". So maybe it\'s the complex with NF-kB bound, hence ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB"".\n\nBut the guidelines say to include states like active if applicable. Since NF-kB is active when it\'s bound to the DNA, maybe ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nI think that\'s a reasonable approach.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: s195 + s206 => s214. Each of these ids (s195, s206, s214) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For s195, the name is NFkB, and the references are NFKB1 and RELA. NFkB is a well-known transcription factor, so that\'s straightforward. The guidelines say that if the term is reasonably interpretable as-is, don\'t change it. So I can keep s195 as ""NFkB"".\n\n- Next, s206 has the name PromIkBa:RNAP3:FTAz. Hmm, this looks a bit complex. The guidelines mention that if the term is an abbreviation or can be interpreted as is, we shouldn\'t make significant changes. The term seems to be a combination of components: PromIkBa (probably promoter region of IkBa), RNAP3 (RNA polymerase III), and FTAz (which might be a fusion or a specific construct). Since it\'s a combination, and the guidelines suggest not to make significant changes if it\'s already interpretable, I can map s206 directly to ""PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz"".\n\n- For s214, the name is IkBa:RNAP3:FTAz:p50p65. Here, we have IkBa, RNAP3, FTAz, and p50p65. IkBa is an inhibitor of NFkB, and p50p65 are subunits of NFkB. The guidelines suggest that if a term can be a single word, we should combine receptor and ligand with an underscore. However, in this case, it\'s a combination of different components. Since each part is a known biological term, I can keep it as is but in the format of a single term by joining with underscores. So it becomes ""IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65"".\n\nI should ensure that each term is a single word, combining components with underscores if necessary. Also, if any term is ambiguous, I should replace it using the guidelines, but in this case, each part seems specific enough. \n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to the terms as I\'ve reasoned above.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

I know that NFkB is a common abbreviation for nuclear factor kappa B, which is a protein complex. The references NFKB1 and RELA correspond to subunits of NFkB. NFKB1 is p50, and RELA is p65. So, s195 likely refers to NFkB as a whole, but since the references mention specific subunits, I might need to represent it as a complex.

PromIkBa suggests a promoter region of IkBa, which is a protein that inhibits NFkB by binding to it. RNAP3 refers to RNA polymerase III. So, this term likely refers to the RNA polymerase III complex associated with the IkBa promoter. Since it\'s a specific complex, I can keep it as ""PromIkBa_RNAP3"" by joining the two parts with an underscore.\n\n- For s212, the name is PromIkBa:RNAP3:p50p65. This seems to be the product, which includes the same promoter and RNAP3 as s205, but now with p50 and p65, which are subunits of NFkB. Since p50 and p65 are part of the NFkB complex, this product represents the active form of NFkB bound to the promoter and RNAP3. I can represent this as ""PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active"" by combining the components and adding \'active\' as a state.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if a term can be a simple receptor or ligand, we should connect them with an underscore. However, in this case, we\'re dealing with a complex of proteins and a promoter, so it\'s more about complexes and their states.

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If a receptor or ligand can be identified, I need to connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". Sometimes, I might need a two-step process: first map the \'id\' to the \'name\' using the replacement table, then refine it using the references. Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be added with an underscore. If the term is already clear, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is s114 + s119 => s190. The replacement table has three entries:\n\n- s114: name is p50, reference is NFKB1\n- s119: name is p65, reference is RELA\n- s190: name is NFkB, reference is NFKB1; RELA\n\nI need to map each \'id\' to a biologically accurate term. \n\nStarting with s114, the name is p50, which is a subunit of NF-κB. The reference is NFKB1, which is the gene symbol for the p50 protein. So, I can map s114 to \'NFKB1\'.\n\nNext, s119 has the name p65, which is another NF-κB subunit. Its reference is RELA, the gene symbol for the p65 protein. So, s119 maps to \'RELA\'.\n\nFor s190, the name is NFkB, which is the complex of p50 and p65. The reference lists both NFKB1 and RELA, indicating the complex is made from these two subunits. Since the name is NFkB, but the references are the individual genes, I think the correct term here is \'NFkB_complex\' to denote the combined form.\n\nI need to ensure each term is a single word. \'NFKB1\' and \'RELA\' are already single words, so no changes needed there. For s190, adding \'_complex\' makes it a single term that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nI also considered if any states like \'active\' or \'bound\' are needed, but in this case, the terms are about the components and their complex, so those states aren\'t necessary here.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each \'id\' to these terms without any additional information.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

Hmm, I\'m not entirely sure what each part stands for. ""RNAP"" likely stands for RNA Polymerase. ""FTAX"" could be an abbreviation, maybe for a specific subunit or a complex. ""Promp105"" might be a promoter element. So, putting it together, this seems to be a complex involving RNA Polymerase and perhaps other factors. Maybe it\'s a transcription initiation complex.\n\n- For s195, the name is ""NFkB"". NF-kB is a well-known transcription factor. The references mention NFKB1 and RELA, which are subunits of the NF-kB complex. So, NF-kB is composed of proteins like p50 (from NFKB1) and p65 (RELA). So, s195 should be mapped to NFkB.\n\n- For s200, the name is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". This looks like a combination of the previous components plus p50 and p65, which are parts of NF-kB.

NFkB is a well-known transcription factor, and its components include NFKB1 (which is p50) and RELA (which is p65). So, s195 should be mapped to NFkB.\n\n- For s206, the name is PromIkBa:RNAP3:FTAz. Hmm, this seems like a complex term. Prom might stand for promoter, IkBa is an inhibitor of NFkB, RNAP3 is RNA polymerase III, and FTAz could be a fusion or a reporter construct. The guideline says that if a term is an abbreviation, we shouldn\'t change it much. Since this is a specific construct, maybe we can leave it as PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz, but perhaps it\'s better to make it a single word. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a fusion protein or a reporter system. Since the name is provided as a single term with colons, perhaps it\'s an identifier. However, the guidelines suggest using the name as is if it\'s interpretable. So, I\'ll map s206 to PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz, connecting the parts with underscores.\n\n- For s214, the name is IkBa:RNAP3:FTAz:p50p65. Similarly, this seems like a combination of proteins. IkBa is an inhibitor, RNAP3 is RNA polymerase III, FTAz might be a reporter, and p50p65 are subunits of NFkB. The references column is empty here, so I need to use the name as is. Following the same logic, I\'ll combine them with underscores: IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65.\n\nWait, but looking at the guidelines, I should consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"". However, in this case, the terms don\'t indicate any such states, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nAnother point is that sometimes a two-step process is needed, first mapping from id to name and then refining using references.

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""R"" maps to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So, I need to check if the \'id\'s are R or L and then find the corresponding receptor or ligand names.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is s190 => s156. The replacement table has two rows. For s190, the name is NFkB with references NFKB1 and RELA. For s156, the name is csa21_degraded, and there\'s no reference.\n\nSo, for s190, NFkB is a well-known transcription factor. The references are NFKB1 and RELA, which are components of the NF-kappa B complex. Since NFkB is a common abbreviation, and the name is already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. I\'ll map s190 to ""NFkB"".\n\nFor s156, the name is csa21_degraded. The \'id\' is s156, but the name is already descriptive, indicating that csa21 is degraded. Since there\'s no reference, I don\'t have additional info to refine it further. It\'s a single term, so I can keep it as is. So, s156 maps to ""csa21_degraded"".\n\nI don\'t see any need for a two-step process here because the names are already clear. There\'s no mention of receptors or ligands in the replacement table, so I don\'t need to combine terms with underscores. Also, the terms don\'t indicate any states like ""active"" or ""bound"", so I won\'t add those.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object should have two keys: s190 and s156, mapping to their respective terms.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

Let me break down the problem.\n\nFirst, I look at the guidelines they provided. Each term needs to be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nThey provided an example where ""s190"" maps to ""NFkB"" and ""s156"" maps to ""csa21_degraded"". So, I need to see how these fit into the guidelines. \n\nLooking at the replacement table, for \'s190\', the name is ""NFkB"" with references ""NFKB1; RELA"". Since ""NFkB"" is already a well-known term in biology, it\'s straightforward. It doesn\'t need any further changes because it\'s a single word and doesn\'t involve receptors or ligands.\n\nFor \'s156\', the name is ""csa21_degraded"". The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation or already interpretable, don\'t change it much. So, ""csa21_degraded"" seems to be a specific term, maybe a protein or molecule that\'s degraded. Since it\'s already descriptive, I can keep it as is without adding any underscores unless there\'s more context.\n\nI should also check if any further processing is needed. For \'s156\', since the reference column is empty, I can\'t get more info from there. So, sticking with ""csa21_degraded"" is the way to go.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map \'s190\' to ""NFkB"" and \'s156\' to ""csa21_degraded"". No additional changes are necessary because both terms are already in a biologically interpretable form and single words as required.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s start by understanding the problem.\n\nFirst, the input has an equation: s199 + s195 => s200. Each of these ids (s199, s195, s200) corresponds to an entry in the replacement table. My task is to map each id to a term that is biologically meaningful, following the guidelines provided.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For s199, the name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"". Hmm, I\'m not entirely sure what each part stands for. ""RNAP"" likely stands for RNA Polymerase. ""FTAX"" could be an abbreviation, maybe for a specific subunit or a complex. ""Promp105"" might be a promoter element. So, putting it together, this seems to be a complex involving RNA Polymerase and perhaps other factors. Maybe it\'s a transcription initiation complex.\n\n- For s195, the name is ""NFkB"". NF-kB is a well-known transcription factor. The references mention NFKB1 and RELA, which are subunits of the NF-kB complex. So, NF-kB is composed of proteins like p50 (from NFKB1) and p65 (RELA). So, s195 should be mapped to NFkB.\n\n- For s200, the name is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". This looks like a combination of the previous components plus p50 and p65, which are parts of NF-kB. So, this might be the active form of the transcription initiation complex, including the NF-kB subunits.\n\nNow, following the guidelines:\n\n- Each term should be a single word. So, I need to combine parts with underscores if necessary.\n\n- If there\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. But in this case, all are transcription factors or complexes, so maybe not applicable.\n\n- If there\'s a state like active or bound, include it as part of the term. For s200, since it includes p50p65, which are active subunits, maybe we should denote it as active.\n\n- If the term is already interpretable, don\'t change it much. For s195, ""NFkB"" is standard, so we can leave it as is.\n\nSo, mapping each id:\n\n- s199: The name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"". Since it\'s a complex, perhaps we can denote it as RNAP bound to promoter elements. Maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"" or something like that. But the guidelines say to make it a single word, so underscores are allowed. Alternatively, since ""RNAP:FTAX"" might be part of the holoenzyme, maybe ""RNAP_holoenzyme"". But without more context, it\'s safer to use the parts as given. So, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"".\n\n- s195: ""NFkB"" is straightforward, so map to ""NFkB"".\n\n- s200: The name is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". This seems to be the active form of the complex with NF-kB bound. So, perhaps ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"" or ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_p50p65_active"". But considering the references, since p50 and p65 are parts of NF-kB, it\'s better to use NFkB. So, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the term is reasonably interpretable, don\'t change it. The names in the replacement table are already somewhat technical. So perhaps for s199, we can use ""RNAP_holoenzyme"" or ""RNAP_bound"" if it\'s bound to the promoter. Alternatively, since the name is ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"", maybe it\'s the RNA Polymerase II holoenzyme bound to the promoter, so ""RNAP2_holoenzyme_bound"".\n\nBut without more context, it\'s hard to be precise. The safest approach is to use the name as is, replacing colons with underscores. So s199 becomes ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"", s195 is ""NFkB"", and s200 is ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_p50p65"".\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to use the name column unless necessary, and the references can help. For s195, the references are NFKB1 and RELA, which are subunits of NF-kB. So the name is already NFkB, which is correct.\n\nFor s200, the name includes p50p65, which are parts of NF-kB, so maybe we can denote it as the active form, hence ""active"". So perhaps ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nBut the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so combining parts with underscores. So for s199, maybe ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"".\n\nSimilarly, s200 would be ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nAlternatively, if s200 is the product, which is the active form, we can denote it as ""active"".\n\nSo, compiling:\n\n{\n  ""s199"": ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX"",\n  ""s195"": ""NFkB"",\n  ""s200"": ""RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active""\n}\n\nBut wait, the replacement table for s199 has ""Promp105:RNAP:FTAX"", so maybe the order is important. So, ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"".\n\nSimilarly, s200 is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"", so ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_p50p65"".\n\nBut since p50 and p65 are parts of NF-kB, maybe we can replace them with NFkB. So s200 becomes ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB"".\n\nBut the guidelines say to consider states like active. So perhaps ""Promp105_RNAP1_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nBut without explicit state information, maybe it\'s safer not to add \'active\' unless the term suggests it.\n\nAlternatively, since s200 includes p50p65, which are the active subunits, perhaps it\'s the active form. So, we can add \'_active\' to denote that.\n\nSo, final JSON:\n\n{\n  ""s199"": ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"",\n  ""s195"": ""NFkB"",\n  ""s200"": ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX_NFkB_active""\n}\n\nBut looking back, the replacement table for s199 has ""FTAX"" and s200 has ""FTAx"". The \'x\' is lowercase in s200, but the guidelines don\'t mention case sensitivity, so maybe it\'s a typo. For consistency, perhaps use ""FTAX"" as in s199.\n\nSo, s200 would be ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX_NFkB_active"".\n\nBut wait, the name for s200 is ""Promp105:RNAP1:FTAx:p50p65"". So the \'FTAx\' might be a typo, perhaps \'FTAX\' as in s199. So, in the JSON, we can correct it to ""FTAX"".\n\nSo, the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""s199"": ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX"",\n  ""s195"": ""NFkB"",\n  ""s200"": ""Promp105_RNAP_FTAX_NFkB_active""\n}\n\nBut the user\'s example used ""IL6_R"" and ""CSF1R_L"", so perhaps for s200, since it\'s a product, it\'s the active form, so adding \'_active\' makes sense.\n\nAlternatively, if the term is already clear, perhaps we don\'t need to add \'active\'. But given that s200 includes the active subunits, it\'s better to denote it as active.\n\nSo, final JSON as above.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

But NFkB is a complex, not a receptor or ligand. So according to the guidelines, if it\'s a simple abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it. But wait, sometimes NFkB is referred to as NF-κB, which is a transcription factor. \n\nI need to check if there\'s a more specific term. The references are NFKB1 and RELA, which are components of the NF-κB complex. So, maybe I should use ""NFκB"" instead of ""NFkB"" for consistency and to use the more standard notation.\n\nSince both s190 and s195 map to NFkB, but in the JSON, each id should have a unique key. So, the JSON would be {""s190"": ""NFκB"", ""s195"": ""NFκB""}. That makes sense because they\'re both the same term but different IDs.\n\nI think that\'s it. I don\'t need to add any states or combine receptors because it\'s not applicable here. Just map each id to the biologically accurate term, which is NFκB.']","['NFkB + Promp105_RNAP => Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'RNAP_Promp105_FTAX + NFkB => RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz => IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3 => PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3 => PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz => IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'NFKB1 + RELA => NFkB_complex', 'RNAP_Promp105_FTAX + NFkB => RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz => IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'NFkB => csa21_degraded', 'NFkB => csa21_degraded', 'Promp105_RNAP_FTAX + NFkB => Promp105_RNAP_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'NFkB => csa17_degraded', 'NFB => NFB', 'NFkB => csa17_degraded', 'NFKB1 + RELA => NFkB_complex', 'NFKB1 + RELA => NFkB_complex', 'NFkB + Promp105_RNAP => Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'NFkB + Promp105_RNAP => Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'NFkB + PromIkBa_RNAP3 => PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'NFB => NFB']","['kf63*NFkB*Promp105_RNAP-kr63*Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'kf64*NFkB*RNAP_Promp105_FTAX-kr64*RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'kf56*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz-kr56*IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'kf55*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3-kr55*PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'kf55*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3-kr55*PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'kf56*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz-kr56*IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'kf52*NFKB1*RELA-kr52*NFkB_complex', 'kf64*NFkB*RNAP_Promp105_FTAX-kr64*RNAP_Promp105_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'kf56*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3_FTAz-kr56*IkBa_RNAP3_FTAz_p50p65', 'k53*NFkB', 'k53*NFkB', 'kf64*NFkB*Promp105_RNAP_FTAX-kr64*Promp105_RNAP_FTAX_NFkB_active', 'k54*NFkB', 'kf15*NFB-kr15*NFB', 'k54*NFkB', 'kf52*NFKB1*RELA-kr52*NFkB_complex', 'kf52*NFKB1*RELA-kr52*NFkB_complex', 'kf63*NFkB*Promp105_RNAP-kr63*Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'kf63*NFkB*Promp105_RNAP-kr63*Promp105_RNAP1_p50p65', 'kf55*NFkB*PromIkBa_RNAP3-kr55*PromIkBa_RNAP3_NFkB_active', 'kf15*NFB-kr15*NFB']","[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]",59.0,13.739386813143701,2.658658137469538,7.0,1.2921444177627563,3.306452541584539,59.0,0.1479875147342682,2.133675280810723,54.66666666666668,2.2751552905967767,27.0,21

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the ID is ""R"", it should become ""IL6_R"" or something similar. But I need to check if the receptor or ligand names are in the ""name"" column. If not, I\'ll have to use context and references to figure it out.\n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. So first, I map the `id` to the `name` using the table, and then I refine it using the references for accuracy. For instance, if an `id` maps to ""TGFb1"" and the reference is ""TGFB1"", I should probably keep it as ""TGFb1"" because it\'s a standard abbreviation and doesn\'t need changing.\n\nStates like ""bound"" or ""active"" should be included as part of the term, joined by an underscore. So if a term is in an active state, it becomes something like ""IL6_R_active"". But if the term is already a simple abbreviation and makes sense as is, I shouldn\'t change it much. Consistency is key here, so I\'ll prioritize the `name` column over the `references` for phrasing.\n\nLooking at the input they provided, the equation is species_6 => species_6 + species_8; species_6. The replacement table has four entries:\n\n1. role: reactants, id: species_6, name: TGFb1, references: TGFB1\n2. role: products, id: species_6, name: TGFb1, references: TGFB1\n3. role: products, id: species_8, name: PAI1, references: SERPINE1\n4. role: modifiers, id: species_6, name: TGFb1, references: TGFB1\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to its term. Let\'s start with species_6. All instances of species_6 point to ""TGFb1"" in the `name` column, and the reference is ""TGFB1"". Since ""TGFb1"" is a standard abbreviation and is already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So species_6 maps to ""TGFb1"".\n\nNext, species_8 maps to ""PAI1"" with the reference ""SERPINE1"". ""PAI1"" is also a standard abbreviation, so I can keep that as is. No need for further changes.\n\nI don\'t see any receptors or ligands mentioned in the `name` column, so I don\'t need to create terms with underscores. Also, there are no states like ""bound"" or ""active"" indicated here, so I don\'t have to add those.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON should have two keys: ""species_6"" and ""species_8"", mapping to ""TGFb1"" and ""PAI1"" respectively.\n\nI think that\'s all. Let me double-check to ensure I didn\'t miss anything. The guidelines say to provide the output as a JSON object without any extra explanations, so I\'ll make sure to format it correctly.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me start by understanding the guidelines.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But in this case, looking at the replacement table, I don\'t see any R or L abbreviations. The IDs are species_6 and species_8.\n\nThe replacement table has three entries. For species_6, the name is TGFb1, and the reference is TGFB1. For species_8, the name is PAI1, and the reference is SERPINE1. \n\nNow, I need to map each id to its term. Since both have clear names that are already biologically meaningful, I can use those directly. There\'s no need for further modification because the names are straightforward and not ambiguous. \n\nSo, species_6 maps to TGFb1, and species_8 maps to PAI1. I don\'t need to add any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" because the information provided doesn\'t indicate any such states. Also, since the names are already interpretable, I won\'t change them unless necessary.\n\nI should structure the JSON with the ids as keys and their corresponding terms as values. So, the output should be a JSON object with two key-value pairs: {""species_6"": ""TGFb1"", ""species_8"": ""PAI1""}.\n\nI think that\'s all. No further steps needed because the terms are already in the correct form and don\'t require any additional processing based on the guidelines.']","['TGFb1 => TGFb1 + PAI1; TGFb1', 'TGFb1 => TGFb1 + PAI1; TGFb1']","['compartment_1*parameter_8*TGFb1', 'compartment_1*parameter_8*TGFb1']","[True, True]",100.0,11.310415358203882,2.088275097996799,148.0,0.9044361710548401,2.1495809082025903,45.0,0.15399496257305145,2.249627531083475,58.166666666666664,2.2278442764195114,34.0,2

Let me start by understanding the guidelines and the input provided.\n\nFirst, the input includes an equation: L_dpEGFR + pShc => pShc_dpEGFR. The replacement table has three entries, each with an id, name, and references. My task is to map each id to a single word term that's biologically meaningful.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n1. **L_dpEGFR** has no name provided, but references are EGFR and EGF. Since the id starts with 'L', I think it stands for ligand. So, the ligand here is EGF. Therefore, L_dpEGFR should be mapped to EGF_L.\n\n2. **pShc** has a reference to SHC1. The 'p' might indicate phosphorylated, but the guidelines say if it's a simple abbreviation, keep it as is. So, pShc could remain pShc, but maybe it's better to use SHC1 as the name. However, the guidelines mention if the name is available, use it. Since the name is empty, perhaps we should use the reference. So pShc becomes SHC1.\n\n3. **pShc_dpEGFR** has references EGF, SHC1, EGFR. The id combines pShc and dpEGFR, so it's a complex. Since it's a product, the term should include both the ligand and receptor. From the reactants, L_dpEGFR is EGF and pShc is SHC1. So the product would be the complex of EGF and SHC1, which can be written as EGF_SHC1.\n\nWait, but the guidelines mention that if the name column is empty, use the references. So for L_dpEGFR, since name is empty, we look at references EGFR and EGF. Since it's a ligand (L), it's EGF. So L_dpEGFR becomes EGF_L.\n\nSimilarly, pShc_dpEGFR is a product, combining EGF and SHC1. So the term would be EGF_SHC1.\n\nBut wait, in the equation, L_dpEGFR is the ligand (EGF), and pShc is the receptor (SHC1). When they bind, the product is the complex of EGF and SHC1. So the JSON should map each id to its term:\n\n- L_dpEGFR → EGF_L\n- pShc → SHC1\n- pShc_dpEGFR → EGF_SHC1\n\nI think that's correct.

Since this is a product, it\'s likely Shc bound to EGFR. So I\'ll use SHC1_EGFR.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would be:\n{\n  ""L_dpEGFR"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""Shc"": ""SHC1"",\n  ""Shc_dpEGFR"": ""SHC1_EGFR""\n}', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher.

The guidelines are a bit detailed, so I need to make sure I follow them carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that the input includes an equation: Shc_dpEGFR becomes pShc_dpEGFR. Then there\'s a replacement table with two rows. Both have the same \'id\'s, Shc_dpEGFR and pShc_dpEGFR, but the \'name\' and \'references\' columns are similar. The \'name\' column is empty for both, but the references include SHC1, EGF, and EGFR.\n\nThe guidelines mention that if the name isn\'t in the table, I should use context and references. So, for Shc_dpEGFR, the references are SHC1, EGF, EGFR. I know that SHC1 is a Shc adapter protein, EGF is epidermal growth factor, and EGFR is the EGF receptor. Since the \'id\' is Shc_dpEGFR, maybe it\'s referring to the Shc protein associated with EGFR. The user also mentioned that if a receptor or ligand can be identified, to connect them with an underscore. So maybe Shc_dpEGFR is SHC1 interacting with EGFR, so it would be SHC1_EGFR.\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example was ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps \'R\' and \'L\' are abbreviations for receptor and ligand. In this case, the \'id\'s are Shc_dpEGFR and pShc_dpEGFR. The \'p\' might stand for phosphorylated, so pShc_dpEGFR could be the phosphorylated form.\n\nLooking at the replacement table, both have the same references, so maybe both are related to the same proteins. So, the term should include the state. The first one, Shc_dpEGFR, might be the unphosphorylated form, and pShc_dpEGFR is the phosphorylated one.\n\nBut the guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, don\'t change it. However, since the name is empty, I should use the references. So, combining SHC1 and EGFR, it\'s SHC1_EGFR. Then, for the phosphorylated state, adding \'_active\' as a state.\n\nSo, Shc_dpEGFR would map to SHC1_EGFR and pShc_dpEGFR would map to SHC1_EGFR_active.

Hmm, but the reference says EGF, so perhaps it\'s better to map it to EGF_L, considering \'L\' as ligand.\n\n2. **pShc** has a name as SHC1 and references SHC1. SHC1 is a protein, so maybe it\'s a receptor? But the id is pShc, which could be a phosphorylated form. Wait, in the equation, pShc is a reactant, and when it binds with L_dpEGFR, it forms pShc_dpEGFR. So, perhaps pShc is a receptor. So, pShc would be the receptor form. Therefore, mapping it to SHC1_R.\n\n3. **pShc_dpEGFR** is the product. The references are EGF, SHC1, EGFR. So, this is likely the bound form of SHC1 and EGFR. Since it\'s a product, it\'s the active or bound state. So, maybe SHC1_EGFR_active or SHC1_EGFR_bound. But the guidelines say to include states like ""active"" or ""bound"" as part of the term with an underscore. So, perhaps SHC1_EGFR_bound or SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nWait, but the id is pShc_dpEGFR, which might be a complex. Since it\'s a product, maybe it\'s the active state. So, perhaps SHC1_EGFR_active. Alternatively, since it\'s a bound state, SHC1_EGFR_bound. But which one is more accurate? I think in biological terms, when a receptor binds a ligand, it becomes active. So maybe active is a better choice.\n\nPutting it together:\n\n- L_dpEGFR → EGF_L (since L is ligand)\n- pShc → SHC1_R (since pShc is a receptor)\n- pShc_dpEGFR → SHC1_EGFR_active (as the bound/active form)\n\nWait, but in the references for pShc_dpEGFR, it\'s EGF, SHC1, EGFR. So perhaps the product is a complex of SHC1 and EGFR, activated by EGF. So, maybe it\'s better to represent it as SHC1_EGFR_bound since it\'s the bound form.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is the active form, so SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure. Let me think again.\n\nThe equation is L_dpEGFR + pShc => pShc_dpEGFR. So, L_dpEGFR is the ligand (EGF), pShc is the receptor (SHC1), and when they bind, they form the product pShc_dpEGFR, which is the active form.\n\nTherefore, the mapping would be:\n\n- L_dpEGFR → EGF_L\n- pShc → SHC1_R\n- pShc_dpEGFR → SHC1_R_active (but wait, the product is a complex, so maybe SHC1_EGFR_bound)\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the product is the active form of SHC1, so SHC1_active. But the product includes dpEGFR, which might be part of the complex.\n\nWait, I\'m getting confused. Let me look at the references again.\n\nFor L_dpEGFR, references are EGFR and EGF. So, it\'s likely EGF as the ligand, so EGF_L.\n\nFor pShc, references are SHC1, so SHC1_R.\n\nFor pShc_dpEGFR, references include EGF, SHC1, EGFR. So, perhaps the product is SHC1 bound to EGFR, activated by EGF. So, maybe SHC1_EGFR_bound or SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nBut the id is pShc_dpEGFR, which might be a complex of SHC1 and dpEGFR. Wait, dpEGFR might be a form of EGFR, perhaps the phosphorylated form. So, perhaps the product is SHC1 bound to active EGFR.\n\nIn that case, the term would be SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nAlternatively, if dpEGFR is the active form, then maybe it\'s SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nSo, putting it all together:\n\n{\n  ""L_dpEGFR"": ""EGF_L"",\n  ""pShc"": ""SHC1_R"",\n  ""pShc_dpEGFR"": ""SHC1_EGFR_active""\n}\n\nWait, but in the equation, pShc is a reactant and becomes part of the product as pShc_dpEGFR. So, perhaps the product is SHC1 bound to EGFR in an active state, hence SHC1_EGFR_active.\n\nAlternatively, if the product is the active form of SHC1, it would be SHC1_active, but I think it\'s more about the complex.\n\nI think I\'ll go with SHC1_EGFR_active as the term for the product.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term.

They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the interleukin-6 receptor, I should write it as ""IL6_R"". Similarly, if it\'s a ligand, like CSF1R_L. \n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. That means I might first map the id to the name using the replacement table and then refine it using the references provided. So I need to look at both the name and the references to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the example equation provided: pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries, two reactants and two products. The ids are pAkt, GSK3B, pAkt, and pGSK3B. The names are pAkt, GSK3b, pAkt, and pGSK3b. The references are a bit more detailed but seem to point to the same proteins.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines, I need to make sure each id is mapped correctly. The term ""pAkt"" is already specific and interpretable as-is. It stands for phosphorylated Akt, so I don\'t need to change it. Similarly, ""GSK3B"" is the gene symbol for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. The name in the table is ""GSK3b"" which is another common abbreviation, but the id is ""GSK3B"", so I should map it to ""GSK3B"".\n\nWait, the replacement table has ""GSK3B"" as id and ""GSK3b"" as name. So should I use the id or the name? The guideline says to prioritize the name column if it has a more interpretable term, but if the id is already specific, maybe it\'s better to use the id. Hmm, but in this case, both are very similar, just a lowercase \'b\' vs uppercase. I think using the id as is is fine.\n\nLooking at the products, ""pGSK3B"" is the id, and the name is ""pGSK3b"". Again, same situation. So I should map ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3B"" or ""pGSK3b""? The guideline says to prioritize the name column for consistency, so perhaps ""pGSK3b"" is better, but the id is ""pGSK3B"". I\'m a bit confused here. Maybe I should stick with the id since it\'s the key, but use the name if it\'s more accurate.\n\nWait, the guideline says to map each id to its corresponding term. So the key in the JSON is the id, and the value is the term. So for id ""pAkt"", the name is ""pAkt"", so the value is ""pAkt"". For id ""GSK3B"", the name is ""GSK3b"", but the id is ""GSK3B"", so do I map it to ""GSK3B"" or ""GSK3b""? The guideline says to prioritize the name column if it\'s more interpretable. So maybe ""GSK3b"" is better. Similarly, for ""pGSK3B"", the name is ""pGSK3b"", so the term should be ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut wait, the references for ""GSK3B"" are just ""GSK3B"", which is the same as the id. So perhaps it\'s acceptable to use ""GSK3B"" as the term. The same applies to ""pGSK3B"". The references for both reactants and products are ""urn:miriam:bao:0002007|urn:miriam:bao:0002007; GSK3B"". So the references point to GSK3B, so the term should be ""GSK3B"".\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have four keys: ""pAkt"", ""GSK3B"", ""pAkt"", and ""pGSK3B"". The values would be ""pAkt"", ""GSK3B"", ""pAkt"", and ""pGSK3B"". But wait, the names are ""pAkt"", ""GSK3b"", ""pAkt"", and ""pGSK3b"". So should I use ""GSK3b"" instead of ""GSK3B""? The guideline says to prioritize the name column, so perhaps I should map ""GSK3B"" to ""GSK3b"" and ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut the id is ""GSK3B"", so the key is ""GSK3B"" and the value is ""GSK3b"". Similarly, ""pGSK3B"" would map to ""pGSK3b"". That makes sense because the name provides a more consistent term.\n\nWait, but the references for ""GSK3B"" are just ""GSK3B"", so maybe it\'s better to stick with that. I\'m a bit torn here. Let me think again: the guideline says to prioritize the name column if it\'s more interpretable, but in this case, the name is just a slight variation. Maybe using the id as is is acceptable since it\'s already a standard abbreviation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants the most biologically accurate term, which might be the name. So for ""GSK3B"", the name is ""GSK3b"", so the term should be ""GSK3b"". Similarly, ""pGSK3B"" would be ""pGSK3b"". That way, the terms are consistent with the name column.\n\nBut wait, in the equation, the reactant is ""GSK3B"" and the product is ""pGSK3B"". So in the JSON, the id ""GSK3B"" maps to ""GSK3b"" and id ""pGSK3B"" maps to ""pGSK3b"". That seems logical.\n\nSo the JSON would look like:\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nWait, but the equation has ""pAkt"" as both reactant and product. So in the JSON, we have two entries for ""pAkt"". But in the JSON object, each key must be unique. So perhaps it\'s sufficient to have one entry for ""pAkt"" since it\'s the same in both reactants and products.\n\nWait, looking back, the replacement table has two entries for ""pAkt"": one as a reactant and one as a product. But the id is the same, so in the JSON, it\'s just one key-value pair.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON should have three keys: ""pAkt"", ""GSK3B"", and ""pGSK3B"". The values would be ""pAkt"", ""GSK3b"", and ""pGSK3b"".\n\nBut I\'m still a bit unsure about whether to use ""GSK3b"" or ""GSK3B"". The name column suggests ""GSK3b"", so I think that\'s the way to go.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the interleukin-6 receptor, I should write it as ""IL6_R"". Similarly, if it\'s a ligand, like CSF1R_L. \n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. That means I might first map the id to the name using the replacement table and then refine it using the references provided. So I need to look at both the name and the references to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the input equation: pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries: pAkt and GSK3B as reactants, and pAkt and pGSK3B as products. The names for pAkt are the same as the ids, and the references point to AKT1 and GSK3B. \n\nSo for each id, I need to map it to a term. Let\'s go step by step.\n\n1. **pAkt (reactant)**: The name is pAkt, and the reference is AKT1. Since pAkt is a well-known abbreviation for phosphorylated AKT, and it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So the term remains ""pAkt"".\n\n2. **GSK3B (reactant)**: The name is GSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. GSK3B is a known kinase, and GSK3b is the same as GSK3B, just a lowercase \'b\'. Since the name is GSK3b, I should use that as it\'s already a single word and consistent.\n\n3. **pAkt (product)**: Same as the reactant. The name is pAkt, references AKT1. So it\'s ""pAkt"".\n\n4. **pGSK3B (product)**: The name is pGSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. Here, the name is pGSK3b, but the reference is GSK3B. I need to decide whether to use the name or the reference. The guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So the term should be ""pGSK3b"".\n\nWait, but the reference for pGSK3B is GSK3B, which is the same as the reactant. Does that mean pGSK3B is the phosphorylated form? Yes, so the name pGSK3b is correct because it\'s phosphorylated GSK3b. So I\'ll keep it as ""pGSK3b"".\n\nI should also check if any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" are needed. The terms here are about phosphorylation, so ""p"" indicates phosphorylation, which is a state. So no need for additional states in the term.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON object only includes the id as the key and the term as the value, without any extra explanations. So the JSON will look like:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, the reactant GSK3B has the name GSK3b. So in the JSON, the key is ""GSK3B"" and the value is ""GSK3b"". Similarly, the product pGSK3B has the name pGSK3b, so the key is ""pGSK3B"" and value is ""pGSK3b"". That makes sense because the id is the key, and the name is the value.\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines. Each term is a single word, and I\'ve used the name from the replacement table where available. No need to add any states beyond the phosphorylation indicated by \'p\'. Also, no receptors or ligands are involved here, so no underscores needed. \n\nSo the final JSON should correctly map each id to its name without any unnecessary changes. I think that\'s all. Let me double-check the references to ensure there\'s no need for further refinement. The references for pAkt point to AKT1, which is correct. GSK3B references itself, so the name GSK3b is appropriate. Everything seems consistent.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nThe input given includes an equation: GSK3B => GSK3Bp; AKTp. Then there\'s a replacement table with roles, ids, names, and references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For GSK3B, the role is reactants, name is GSK3B, references are GSK3B. Since it\'s an abbreviation and straightforward, maybe it doesn\'t need a change. The term is already a single word, so perhaps it remains GSK3B.\n\n- Next, GSK3Bp is a product, name is GSK3Bp, references are GSK3B. This seems like a phosphorylated form. So maybe the term becomes GSK3Bp, which is a single word, so it stays as is.\n\n- AKTp is a modifier, name is AKTp, references are AKT1. AKT is a well-known kinase, and the \'p\' likely stands for phosphorylated. So the term would be AKTp, which is a single word.\n\nI should check if any of these need further processing. For example, if any of the ids correspond to receptors or ligands, I would combine them with an underscore. But in this case, GSK3B is a kinase, and AKTp is a kinase as well. So, they don\'t seem to be receptors or ligands.\n\nAlso, the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation and interpretable, don\'t change it. Since all these are abbreviations for proteins, they should remain as they are.\n\nSo, the JSON object would map each id to its name as given because they are already biologically interpretable and single words. No further processing is needed beyond mapping them directly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The \'AKTp\' is a modifier, but in the references, it\'s listed as AKT1. Should I consider changing AKTp to AKT1p? But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency, so I should stick with AKTp.\n\nYes, that makes sense. So, the final JSON would have the keys as the ids and the values as their corresponding names, which are already interpretable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

The replacement table has four entries: pAkt and GSK3B as reactants, and pAkt and pGSK3B as products. The names for pAkt are the same as the ids, and the references point to AKT1 and GSK3B. \n\nSo for each id, I need to map it to a term. Let\'s go step by step.\n\n1. **pAkt (reactant)**: The name is pAkt, and the reference is AKT1. Since pAkt is a well-known abbreviation for phosphorylated AKT, and it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it.

So it\'s ""pAkt"".\n\n4. **pGSK3B (product)**: The name is pGSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. Here, the name is pGSK3b, but the reference is GSK3B. I need to decide whether to use the name or the reference. The guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So the term should be ""pGSK3b"".\n\nWait, but the reference for pGSK3B is GSK3B, which is the same as the reactant. Does that mean pGSK3B is the phosphorylated form? Yes, so the name pGSK3b is correct because it\'s phosphorylated GSK3b. So I\'ll keep it as ""pGSK3b"".\n\nI should also check if any states like ""bound"" or ""active"" are needed. The terms here are about phosphorylation, so ""p"" indicates phosphorylation, which is a state. So no need for additional states in the term.\n\nI need to make sure that the JSON object only includes the id as the key and the term as the value, without any extra explanations. So the JSON will look like:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nWait, but in the replacement table, the reactant GSK3B has the name GSK3b.

That makes sense because the id is the key, and the name is the value.\n\nI think that covers all the guidelines.

The replacement table has four entries: pAkt and GSK3B as reactants, and pAkt and pGSK3B as products. \n\nFor each id, I need to see what the name and references say. For pAkt, the name is pAkt, and the references mention AKT1. The id GSK3B has the name GSK3b, and the references also say GSK3B. The products are the same as the reactants except for pGSK3B, which has the name pGSK3b and references GSK3B.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines, if the name is already interpretable as-is, I shouldn\'t change it.

Should I change the case? Hmm, the guidelines say to prioritize the name column, so I\'ll go with pGSK3b for the product. But looking back, the product id is pGSK3B and the name is pGSK3b. I\'m a bit confused about the case here. Maybe it\'s a typo, but I\'ll follow the name as it\'s provided.\n\nWait, but in the input, the reactants and products both have pAkt and GSK3B. The products have pGSK3B. So, perhaps in the JSON, each id maps to its name. So, pAkt maps to pAkt, GSK3B maps to GSK3b, and pGSK3B maps to pGSK3b. But the user provided the replacement table, so I need to follow that.\n\nWait, the replacement table for GSK3B has the name as GSK3b, and the id is GSK3B. So in the JSON, the key is id, and the value is the name. So for GSK3B, the value is GSK3b. Similarly, pGSK3B maps to pGSK3b.\n\nBut in the output example the user provided, they had ""pAkt"" as the value for both reactants and products. So, I think I should follow that. Maybe the case doesn\'t matter as much as the term itself. So, I\'ll map each id to its name as given in the replacement table.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the JSON will have four entries: pAkt, GSK3B, pAkt, and pGSK3B. Their corresponding values are pAkt, GSK3b, pAkt, and pGSK3b. But since JSON keys are unique, I need to make sure each id is a unique key. Wait, in the input, pAkt appears twice, once as a reactant and once as a product. So in the JSON, the key pAkt will map to pAkt, and the key pGSK3B will map to pGSK3b. The other entries are GSK3B and pGSK3B.\n\nWait, but the user\'s example output only had two entries. Maybe they only need unique ids mapped. Let me check the example they provided. Oh, they had:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3B"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3B""\n}\n\nBut in their replacement table, GSK3B\'s name is GSK3b. So perhaps they want to use the name as the value, even if the case differs. So, the JSON would have:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3b"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3b""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not sure if the user expects the case to change. The guidelines don\'t mention case sensitivity, so maybe it\'s better to keep the name as provided.

Hmm, I need to look for those cases in the data.\n\nThe user also pointed out that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first mapping from `id` to `name`, and then refining using references. So I need to check both columns to ensure accuracy. For example, if an `id` is ""R"", I should look at the `name` to see if it\'s a receptor and then refer to the references to confirm.\n\nAnother important point is including states like ""bound"" or ""active"" by adding an underscore, such as ""IL6_R_active"". I should check if any terms in the data have such states and handle them accordingly. If the term is a simple abbreviation, like ""pAkt"", I shouldn\'t change it unless necessary. Consistency is key, so I\'ll prioritize the `name` column over the `references` if there are synonyms.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided, the equation is pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has the following:\n\n- pAkt as a reactant and product, with the name pAkt and reference AKT1.\n- GSK3B as a reactant, name GSK3b, reference GSK3B.\n- pGSK3B as a product, name pGSK3b, reference GSK3B.\n\nI need to map each `id` to a biologically interpretable term. Let\'s process each one:\n\n1. **pAkt**: The `name` is pAkt, which stands for phosphorylated Akt. Since it\'s already specific and a single word, I can use it as is. No changes needed here.\n2. **GSK3B**: The `id` is GSK3B, and the `name` is GSK3b. The reference is GSK3B, which is the same as the `id`. Since the `name` is slightly different (lowercase \'b\'), but the user wants to prioritize the `name` column, I should use GSK3b. However, looking at the output example, they used GSK3B. Maybe because the `id` is GSK3B, so I\'ll stick with GSK3B for consistency.\n3. **pGSK3B**: The `id` is pGSK3B, the `name` is pGSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. Similar to GSK3B, I\'ll use pGSK3B as it\'s more consistent with the `id` and the biological term for phosphorylated GSK3B.\n\nWait, but in the output example, the user had ""pAkt"" and ""pGSK3B"". So I think it\'s okay to use the `id` as is if the `name` is just a slight variation. So I\'ll proceed with that.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would have keys as the `id`s and values as the processed terms. So pAkt remains pAkt, GSK3B becomes GSK3B, and pGSK3B becomes pGSK3B.\n\nI should make sure that each term is a single word, which they are. No receptors or ligands are involved here, so I don\'t need to combine them with an underscore. Also, there\'s no mention of states like ""bound"" or ""active"" in the data, so I don\'t need to add those.\n\nFinally, I need to ensure that the JSON is correctly formatted without any additional comments or explanations. Just the key-value pairs as specified.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

So I need to look at both the name and the references to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the example equation provided: pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries, two reactants and two products. The ids are pAkt, GSK3B, pAkt, and pGSK3B. The names are pAkt, GSK3b, pAkt, and pGSK3b. The references are a bit more detailed but seem to point to the same proteins.\n\nNow, considering the guidelines, I need to make sure each id is mapped correctly. The term ""pAkt"" is already specific and interpretable as-is. It stands for phosphorylated Akt, so I don\'t need to change it. Similarly, ""GSK3B"" is the gene symbol for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta. The name in the table is ""GSK3b"" which is another common abbreviation, but the id is ""GSK3B"", so I should map it to ""GSK3B"".\n\nWait, the replacement table has ""GSK3B"" as id and ""GSK3b"" as name. So should I use the id or the name? The guideline says to prioritize the name column if it has a more interpretable term, but if the id is already specific, maybe it\'s better to use the id. Hmm, but in this case, both are very similar, just a lowercase \'b\' vs uppercase. I think using the id as is is fine.\n\nLooking at the products, ""pGSK3B"" is the id, and the name is ""pGSK3b"". Again, same situation. So I should map ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3B"" or ""pGSK3b""? The guideline says to prioritize the name column for consistency, so perhaps ""pGSK3b"" is better, but the id is ""pGSK3B"". I\'m a bit confused here. Maybe I should stick with the id since it\'s the key, but use the name if it\'s more accurate.\n\nWait, the guideline says to map each id to its corresponding term. So the key in the JSON is the id, and the value is the term. So for id ""pAkt"", the name is ""pAkt"", so the value is ""pAkt"".

But the names are ""pAkt"", ""GSK3b"", ""pAkt"", and ""pGSK3b"". So perhaps the names are more accurate. But the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. So ""pAkt"" is a standard term, so it\'s fine. ""GSK3B"" is the gene symbol, so it\'s also fine. ""pGSK3B"" is the phosphorylated form, so that\'s also fine.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3B"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3B""\n}\n\nI think that makes sense. Each id is mapped to its corresponding term without unnecessary changes, as they are already biologically interpretable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s acting as a biological researcher. They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones. If I can identify specific receptors or ligands, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, joined by underscores.\n\nThe input given includes an equation: GSK3B => GSK3Bp; AKTp. Then there\'s a replacement table with roles, ids, names, and references. \n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- For GSK3B, the role is reactants, name is GSK3B, references are GSK3B. Since it\'s an abbreviation and straightforward, maybe it doesn\'t need a change. The term is already a single word, so perhaps it remains GSK3B.\n\n- Next, GSK3Bp is a product, name is GSK3Bp, references are GSK3B. This seems like a phosphorylated form. So maybe the term becomes GSK3Bp, which is a single word, so it stays as is.\n\n- AKTp is a modifier, name is AKTp, references are AKT1. AKT is a well-known kinase, and the \'p\' likely stands for phosphorylated. So the term would be AKTp, which is a single word.\n\nI should check if any of these need further processing. For example, if any of the ids correspond to receptors or ligands, I would combine them with an underscore. But in this case, GSK3B is a kinase, and AKTp is a kinase as well. So, they don\'t seem to be receptors or ligands.\n\nAlso, the guidelines say that if the term is a simple abbreviation and interpretable, don\'t change it. Since all these are abbreviations for proteins, they should remain as they are.\n\nSo, the JSON object would map each id to its name as given because they are already biologically interpretable and single words. No further processing is needed beyond mapping them directly.\n\nWait, but let me think again. The \'AKTp\' is a modifier, but in the references, it\'s listed as AKT1. Should I consider changing AKTp to AKT1p? But the guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency, so I should stick with AKTp.\n\nYes, so the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3B"",\n  ""GSK3Bp"": ""GSK3Bp"",\n  ""AKTp"": ""AKTp""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it.

So I need to use context and the references provided to accurately substitute them. Sometimes, a two-step process is needed: first mapping the id to the name, then refining it using the references for more biological accuracy.\n\nLooking at the example equation provided: pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has reactants and products with their respective ids, names, and references. The goal is to map each id to a single-word term that\'s biologically meaningful.\n\nIn this case, both pAkt and GSK3B are present in both reactants and products. The names are pAkt and GSK3b (note the lowercase \'b\' in the replacement table). The references for pAkt point to BAO URIs and AKT1, while GSK3B references itself. \n\nSo, for each id:\n- pAkt is already a common abbreviation for phosphorylated Akt, which is a well-known protein in signaling pathways. Since it\'s a standard term and the name in the table is ""pAkt"", there\'s no need for further modification. It\'s already a single word and interpretable.\n- GSK3B is another common abbreviation for glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta.

So, I should only modify terms when necessary, not just for the sake of changing.\n\nThe replacement table they provided has four entries: pAkt and GSK3B as reactants, and pAkt and pGSK3B as products. Each has an `id`, `name`, and `reference`. Let me look at each one.\n\nStarting with the first row: reactant pAkt. The `id` is pAkt, `name` is pAkt, and `reference` is AKT1. Since pAkt is a common abbreviation for phosphorylated AKT, and it\'s already a single word, I think it\'s acceptable as is. The reference AKT1 suggests it\'s the first isoform of AKT, but since the `name` is pAkt, I\'ll stick with that unless the guidelines require more specificity.\n\nNext, reactant GSK3B. The `id` is GSK3B, `name` is GSK3b (lowercase \'b\'), and reference is GSK3B. I notice the `name` has a lowercase \'b\', which might be a typo or just a different notation. The `id` is in uppercase, so I should probably use the `id` as the term since it\'s more standard, so GSK3B.\n\nMoving to the products: pAkt again. Same as the reactant, so it\'s pAkt. Then, pGSK3B. The `id` is pGSK3B, `name` is pGSK3b, and reference is GSK3B. Again, the `name` has a lowercase \'b\', but the `id` is pGSK3B.

No states like active or bound are indicated, so those aren\'t necessary either.\n\nI think that\'s it. Each `id` maps directly to its `name` without further modification.

So the reference is the same as the id, so maybe it\'s okay to use the id as the term.\n\nIn that case, the JSON would map ""pAkt"" to ""pAkt"", ""GSK3B"" to ""GSK3B"", and ""pGSK3B"" to ""pGSK3B"". But the names are ""pAkt"", ""GSK3b"", ""pAkt"", and ""pGSK3b"". So perhaps the names are more accurate. But the guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. So ""pAkt"" is a standard term, so it\'s fine. ""GSK3B"" is the gene symbol, so it\'s also fine. ""pGSK3B"" is the phosphorylated form, so that\'s also fine.\n\nSo the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""pAkt"": ""pAkt"",\n  ""GSK3B"": ""GSK3B"",\n  ""pGSK3B"": ""pGSK3B""\n}\n\nI think that makes sense. Each id is mapped to its corresponding term without unnecessary changes, as they are already biologically interpretable.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in their replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines they provided to make sure I understand correctly.\n\nFirst, each term in the JSON must be a single word. That means if there\'s a receptor or ligand involved, I might need to combine them with an underscore. For example, if the id is ""R"" and it refers to the interleukin-6 receptor, I should write it as ""IL6_R"". Similarly, if it\'s a ligand, like CSF1R_L. \n\nThey also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed. That means I might first map the id to the name using the replacement table and then refine it using the references provided. So I need to look at both the name and the references to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the input equation: pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B. The replacement table has four entries: pAkt and GSK3B as reactants, and pAkt and pGSK3B as products. The names for pAkt are the same as the ids, and the references point to AKT1 and GSK3B. \n\nSo for each id, I need to map it to a term. Let\'s go step by step.\n\n1. **pAkt (reactant)**: The name is pAkt, and the reference is AKT1. Since pAkt is a well-known abbreviation for phosphorylated AKT, and it\'s already a single word, I don\'t need to change it. So the term remains ""pAkt"".\n\n2. **GSK3B (reactant)**: The name is GSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. GSK3B is a known kinase, and GSK3b is the same as GSK3B, just a lowercase \'b\'. Since the name is GSK3b, I should use that as it\'s already a single word and consistent.\n\n3. **pAkt (product)**: Same as the reactant. The name is pAkt, references AKT1. So it\'s ""pAkt"".\n\n4. **pGSK3B (product)**: The name is pGSK3b, and the reference is GSK3B. Here, the name is pGSK3b, but the reference is GSK3B. I need to decide whether to use the name or the reference. The guidelines say to prioritize the name column for consistency. So the term should be ""pGSK3b"".\n\nWait, but the reference for pGSK3B is GSK3B, which is the same as the reactant. Does that mean pGSK3B is the phosphorylated form? Yes, so the name pGSK3b reflects that phosphorylation. So I should keep it as ""pGSK3b"".\n\nI should make sure that the JSON keys are the ids and the values are the terms. So the JSON will have four key-value pairs.\n\nLet me check if any of these need to be more specific or if any abbreviations need expanding. Since pAkt and GSK3b are standard terms in biology, they are acceptable as is. There\'s no indication that they need to be changed to full names or combined with other terms like receptors or ligands here. \n\nAlso, there\'s no mention of states like ""bound"" or ""active"" in the terms, so I don\'t need to add those here. \n\nSo the final JSON should map each id to its corresponding term as per the name column, which in this case is straightforward.']","['pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'GSK3B => GSK3Bp; AKTp', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'GSK3B => GSK3Bp; AKTp', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b', 'pAkt + GSK3B => pAkt + pGSK3B', 'pAkt + GSK3b => pAkt + pGSK3b']","['Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*k_GP*AKTp*GSK3B/(K_GP+GSK3B)', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*k_GP*AKTp*GSK3B/(K_GP+GSK3B)', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3B*pAkt/Cell', 'Cell*Kcat27b*GSK3b*pAkt/Cell']","[True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True, True]",15.0,18.016275061248386,3.662978099105164,12.0,1.226803183555603,3.1114826873545116,74.0,0.14286550879478455,2.034813313044756,63.916666666666686,2.26021615974227,28.0,20

They want me to generate a JSON object that maps each \'id\' from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines provided. Each term must be a single word, and ambiguous terms should be replaced with more specific ones. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". Also, states like ""bound"" or ""active"" can be part of the term, connected with an underscore.\n\nI need to check if the replacement table has the necessary information. The table has four columns: role, id, name, and references. For each id, I have to map it to a biologically meaningful term. \n\nLooking at the input, the equation is ""MHC2; IFNy, TGFb"". The replacement table includes MHC2, IFNy, and TGFb as ids. \n\nStarting with MHC2: The role is products, name is MHC2, and references are empty. Since there\'s no reference, I can keep it as MHC2 because it\'s already a known term in biology, specifically Major Histocompatibility Complex class II. No changes needed here.\n\nNext, IFNy: The role is modifiers, name is IFNy, and the reference is IFNG. IFNy stands for interferon gamma. The reference points to IFNG, which is another abbreviation for interferon gamma. So, I can map IFNy to ""IFNG"" because it\'s more specific and widely recognized. \n\nThen, TGFb: The role is modifiers, name is TGFb, and reference is TGFB1. TGFb is transforming growth factor beta, and TGFB1 is the specific gene symbol for the beta-1 form. So, I should map TGFb to ""TGFB1"" for clarity and specificity.\n\nI also need to ensure that each term is a single word. MHC2 is already one word, IFNy becomes IFNG, and TGFb becomes TGFB1. None of these require combining with an underscore because they\'re not receptors or ligands in this context.\n\nI should make sure not to add any explanations or comments, just the JSON object as specified. \n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object will have keys as the ids and values as the mapped terms.

Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input, there are two ids: mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8 and mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d. Both are present in the replacement table.\n\nFor the first id, mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8, the name is MKK1/2 and the reference is MAP2K2. The guidelines suggest using the name column if possible, so I should use MKK1/2. But wait, the name is an abbreviation. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as-is. So MKK1/2 is acceptable.\n\nFor the second id, mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d, the name is ERK1/2 and the reference is MAPK3. Again, the name ERK1/2 is an abbreviation. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s reasonably interpretable. So ERK1/2 is fine.\n\nNow, I need to make sure each term is a single word. MKK1/2 and ERK1/2 are already single words, so no changes are needed there.\n\nI don\'t see any mentions of receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to create terms with underscores for those. Also, there\'s no state like bound or active mentioned, so I can skip that part.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its corresponding name. That would be:\n\n{\n  ""mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8"": ""MKK1/2"",\n  ""mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d"": ""ERK1/2""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it. I don\'t see any other steps needed here since the names are already appropriate and single words.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines to make sure I get this right.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. That means no spaces or multiple words. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, if the ID is ""R"", it becomes ""IL6_R"". But I need to check if the names are in the ""name"" column or if I need to use context from references.\n\nLooking at the input, there are two equations: ERK1 becomes pERK1, and ppMEK2. The replacement table has three entries: ERK1, pERK1, and ppMEK2. \n\nStarting with ERK1. The ""name"" column is empty, but the references point to MAPK3. So ERK1 should map to MAPK3. That\'s straightforward because it\'s a single word.\n\nNext, pERK1. The ""name"" is empty, but the references mention MOD%3A00048 and MAPK3. Since pERK1 is phosphorylated ERK1, which is a form of MAPK3, maybe it should be MAPK3_active or something. But the guideline says if it\'s a simple abbreviation, leave it as is. However, the name is empty, so I need to use the reference. Since the reference is MOD%3A00048 and MAPK3, I think pERK1 is an abbreviation for phosphorylated ERK1, which is MAPK3. So pERK1 should map to pMAPK3.\n\nThen, ppMEK2. The name is empty, but the references mention MAP2K2 and some MODs. MEK2 is MAP2K2, and ppMEK2 likely stands for phosphorylated MEK2. So the term should be MAP2K2, but with the state. Since it\'s phosphorylated, it might be active. So ppMEK2 becomes MAP2K2_active.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to use the ""name"" column if possible. Since the name is empty, I have to use the references. So ERK1 is MAPK3, pERK1 is pMAPK3, and ppMEK2 is MAP2K2_active.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its corresponding term. So ERK1 is MAPK3, pERK1 is pMAPK3, and ppMEK2 is MAP2K2_active.\n\nI think that\'s it. Let me double-check to make sure each term is a single word and follows the guidelines. ERK1 is replaced by MAPK3, pERK1 becomes pMAPK3, and ppMEK2 is MAP2K2_active. Yes, that should work.', ""Okay, so I'm trying to help this user who's an excellent biological researcher.

So eph stays as eph.\n\nThen zp. Role is modifier, id is zp, name is MAPK3, reference is MAPK3.

Each term should be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, combine them with an underscore. For example, R becomes IL6_R. I should also consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" by adding them with an underscore.\n\nThe input equation is => zpp; ypp, zp, z, eph. So, the ids to map are zpp, ypp, zp, z, and eph.\n\nLooking at the replacement table:\n\n- zpp is a product with id zpp, name is empty, and reference is MAPK3.\n- ypp is a modifier, name empty, reference MAP2K2.\n- zp is a modifier, name MAPK3, reference empty.\n- z is a modifier, name MAPK3, reference empty.\n- eph is a modifier, name and reference empty.\n\nStarting with zpp: The reference is MAPK3, so maybe it\'s the product. Since it\'s a product, perhaps it\'s the active form. So zpp could be MAPK3_active.\n\nypp\'s reference is MAP2K2. MAP2K2 is MEK2, which is a kinase. So ypp might be MEK2 or MAP2K2. The name is empty, so I\'ll go with the reference, maybe MAP2K2.\n\nzp\'s name is MAPK3. So zp is MAPK3. Since it\'s a modifier, maybe it\'s a receptor?

Maybe EPH ligand? But I don\'t have info. Alternatively, it might be a receptor. But without data, I\'ll leave it as eph, but maybe it\'s EPHR or something. Wait, the guidelines say if it\'s an abbreviation, leave it as is. So eph remains eph.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- zpp: MAPK3_active\n- ypp: MAP2K2\n- zp: MAPK3\n- z: MAPK3\n- eph: eph\n\nWait, but the user example used underscores for receptor and ligand. Since eph is a modifier, maybe it\'s a receptor. So perhaps EPHR. But without more info, I\'m not sure. Maybe I should just use eph as is, since the guidelines suggest not to change if it\'s an abbreviation.\n\nSo the JSON would map each id accordingly.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and input to figure out the best way to approach this.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the guidelines carefully. Each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I might need to connect them with an underscore. But in this case, the terms don\'t seem to be receptors or ligands, so that part might not apply here. \n\nThe input includes an equation: ERK1 => pERK1; ppMEK2. The replacement table has three rows. Let\'s look at each one.\n\nStarting with the first row: role is reactants, id is ERK1, name is empty, and references point to MAPK3. Since the name is empty, I need to rely on the references. MAPK3 is the name, so ERK1 should map to MAPK3. But wait, ERK1 is often known as MAPK3, so that makes sense. But since the name is empty, maybe I should just use the id as is, but the reference suggests MAPK3. Hmm, but the guidelines say if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s okay to leave it as is. ERK1 is a common abbreviation, so maybe it\'s better to map ERK1 to ERK1. But the reference says MAPK3. I\'m a bit confused here. Wait, the guidelines also say to prioritize the name column, but if it\'s empty, then use the reference. So maybe ERK1 should map to MAPK3.\n\nWait, but the output example provided by the user maps ERK1 to ERK1, pERK1 to pERK1, and ppMEK2 to MEK2. Hmm, that\'s interesting. So perhaps in this case, they\'re keeping the id as the term, even though the reference suggests a different name. Maybe because the name is empty, they prefer to keep the id. Alternatively, perhaps because the name is empty, but the reference is more specific, but the user\'s example didn\'t use the reference. I\'m a bit confused. Let me look back.\n\nThe user provided an example output where ERK1 maps to ERK1, pERK1 maps to pERK1, and ppMEK2 maps to MEK2. So perhaps they want to keep the id as the term unless there\'s a more interpretable name. In the case of ERK1, the name is empty, so maybe just use the id. But for ppMEK2, the name is empty, but the references include MEK2, so maybe ppMEK2 should map to MEK2.\n\nWait, but in the replacement table for ppMEK2, the references include MAP2K2 and MOD%3A00048 and MOD%3A00047. But the name is empty. So perhaps ppMEK2 is the id, but the reference suggests it\'s MAP2K2. However, the user\'s example output maps ppMEK2 to MEK2. MEK2 is a common name for MAP2K2, so maybe that\'s the preferred term.\n\nSimilarly, for pERK1, the name is empty but the reference points to MOD%3A00048 and MAPK3. But the user\'s example maps pERK1 to pERK1. So perhaps they want to keep the id as the term unless the name provides a more interpretable term.\n\nSo putting it all together, ERK1 maps to ERK1, pERK1 maps to pERK1, and ppMEK2 maps to MEK2.\n\nI need to structure the JSON object with these mappings. So the keys are the ids, and the values are the terms. So it should look like:\n\n{\n  ""ERK1"": ""ERK1"",\n  ""pERK1"": ""pERK1"",\n  ""ppMEK2"": ""MEK2""\n}\n\nWait, but in the example, the user mapped ppMEK2 to MEK2, so that\'s correct. ERK1 and pERK1 are kept as is because the name column is empty, but the references might suggest otherwise, but the user\'s example kept them as ids. So perhaps the correct approach is to use the id as the term if the name is empty, unless the reference provides a more standard term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the user wants to map ERK1 to MAPK3, but in the example, they didn\'t do that. So maybe the priority is to use the id if the name is empty, even if the reference suggests otherwise. Or perhaps the name is empty, so we look for the most appropriate term from the references. But in the example, they kept ERK1 as ERK1, so I\'ll follow that.\n\nSo the final JSON object is as the user provided in the example.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need a JSON object that maps each `id` in the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me break down the guidelines and the input to figure out how to approach this.\n\nFirst, the guidelines say each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". Also, if there\'s a state like ""bound"" or ""active"", I should include that with an underscore too, like ""IL6_R_active"".\n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation: pERK1 => ppERK1; ppMEK2. The replacement table has three rows with roles as reactants, products, and modifiers, each with their own IDs, names, and references.\n\nStarting with pERK1. The role is reactant, id is pERK1, and the name is empty. The references mention MOD identifiers and MAPK3. I know that ERK1 is MAPK3, so pERK1 is phosphorylated MAPK3. Since it\'s a reactant, maybe it\'s in an active state. So I\'ll map it to ""MAPK3_active"".\n\nNext, ppERK1 is a product. The references again point to MOD identifiers and MAPK3. Since it\'s doubly phosphorylated, this is the active form of MAPK3. So it should be ""MAPK3_active"".\n\nThen, ppMEK2 is a modifier. The references list MAP2K2, which is MEK2. Since it\'s doubly phosphorylated, this is the active state. So I\'ll map it to ""MAP2K2_active"".\n\nI need to make sure each term is a single word, so I\'m combining the base name with the state using an underscore. Since the names in the replacement table are either empty or have the MOD identifiers, I\'m relying on the references to identify the correct biological terms. I\'m prioritizing the phrasing from the name column where possible, but in this case, the names are empty, so references are key.\n\nI should avoid making unnecessary changes if the term is already interpretable. In this case, the terms like ppMEK2 are abbreviations, but I\'m converting them to full names with states for clarity.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should map each id to its corresponding term, ensuring each is a single, biologically meaningful word.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

I should prioritize the name column if available, but since they\'re empty, I use the references. Also, I don\'t add unnecessary changes if the term is already interpretable, but in this case, the states are important, so I include them.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON should have keys for pERK1, ppERK1, and ppMEK2, each pointing to their respective terms.', 'Okay, so I need to generate a JSON object that maps each id from the replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. Let me go through the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, looking at the input, there are two ids: mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8 and mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d. Both are present in the replacement table.\n\nFor the first id, mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8, the name is MKK1/2 and the reference is MAP2K2. The guidelines suggest using the name column if possible, so I should use MKK1/2. But wait, the name is an abbreviation. The guidelines say if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can leave it as-is. So MKK1/2 is acceptable.\n\nFor the second id, mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d, the name is ERK1/2 and the reference is MAPK3. Again, the name ERK1/2 is an abbreviation. The guidelines say to use the name if it\'s reasonably interpretable. So ERK1/2 is fine.\n\nNow, I need to make sure each term is a single word. MKK1/2 and ERK1/2 are already single words, so no changes are needed there.\n\nI don\'t see any mentions of receptors or ligands here, so I don\'t need to create terms with underscores for those. Also, there\'s no state like bound or active mentioned, so I can skip that part.\n\nSo, the JSON should map each id to its corresponding name. That would be:\n\n{\n  ""mw75377e12_e23d_44b3_9823_5fac9b23edc8"": ""MKK1/2"",\n  ""mw67d0cf04_d6a7_4725_a869_098a96a3350d"": ""ERK1/2""\n}\n\nI think that\'s it.

I know that pERK stands for phosphorylated ERK, and ERK is a mitogen-activated protein kinase, specifically MAPK1. Since the name is pERK, which is an abbreviation, I should see if it\'s better to use the full term or the abbreviation. The guidelines say if it\'s an abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, it\'s okay to leave it as is. So species_10 should map to pERK.\n\nNext, the second row: role is products, id is species_11, name is ERK, references is MAPK1. ERK is the same as MAPK1.

Raf1 is the protein, and the name includes ""_Active"" which indicates its state. According to the guidelines, states like ""active"" can be included with an underscore. Since the name already has ""Raf1_Active,"" which is specific, I should use that.

If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". But sometimes, the names might not be in the ""name"" column, so I\'ll have to use context and references to figure them out. It might take two steps: first, map the id to the name, then refine it using references.\n\nAlso, if there are states like ""bound"" or ""active,"" I should include them as part of the term with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation or clear enough, I shouldn\'t change it too much. For example, if the name is ""MAPK"", maybe it\'s better to leave it as is unless the reference suggests otherwise.\n\nLooking at the replacement table provided, the role is either products or modifiers. The ids are C_Raf, C_Raf_inactive, and MAPK. The names are C-Raf, C-Raf inactive, and MAPK. The references are RAF1, RAF1, and MAPK1. \n\nStarting with C_Raf. The name is C-Raf, which is an abbreviation for RAF1. Since it\'s already a single word, maybe just replace the hyphen with an underscore? So C_Raf becomes ""C_Raf"". But the reference is RAF1, which is a protein kinase. So maybe the full term is RAF1, but the name is C-Raf. Since the guideline says to prioritize the name column, I think ""C_Raf"" is acceptable as a single word, so the term would be ""C_Raf"".\n\nNext, C_Raf_inactive. The name is ""C-Raf inactive"", which is a state. Since it\'s a state, I should include it with an underscore. So it becomes ""C_Raf_inactive"".\n\nThen, MAPK. The name is ""MAPK"", which is an abbreviation for Mitogen-activated protein kinase. The reference is MAPK1. Since MAPK is already a single word and widely recognized, I think it\'s best to leave it as ""MAPK"" rather than expanding it to MAPK1, as per the guidelines.\n\nSo putting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to its corresponding term:\n\n- C_Raf → ""C_Raf""\n- C_Raf_inactive → ""C_Raf_inactive""\n- MAPK → ""MAPK""\n\nI think that\'s it.

Let me start by understanding the guidelines.\n\nFirst, each term must be a single word. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should combine them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"".

Similarly, p38_P references MAPK14. For Caspase_A, the name is also empty, but the reference is CASP3 again. So, I think Caspase_I and Caspase_A both refer to caspase 3, just in different forms. \n\nSince the guidelines mention that if the term is an abbreviation and interpretable as-is, we shouldn\'t change it much. So, Caspase_I might just be ""Caspase_I"" and Caspase_A as ""Caspase_A"". The same logic applies to p38_P, which might just stay as ""p38_P"".\n\nWait, but p38 is a MAPK, specifically MAPK14. Should I use the full name? The guidelines suggest using the `name` column if available, but since it\'s empty, I should use the reference. So maybe p38_P should be ""MAPK14_P""? But the guidelines also say that if it\'s a simple abbreviation, we can keep it as is. Hmm, but the replacement table has both `id` and `references`. Maybe I should map p38_P to ""MAPK14_P"" for clarity.\n\nWait, the replacement table has `id` and `references`, but the `name` is empty. So perhaps the `id` itself is the term to use unless it\'s ambiguous. Since ""p38_P"" is a common abbreviation, maybe it\'s better to keep it as ""p38_P"" to avoid confusion. \n\nSimilarly, Caspase_I and Caspase_A are forms of caspase 3, but the `id`s are given, so I should use them. So the JSON would map each `id` directly to the term as-is, unless they need to be more specific.\n\nWait, but the guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms with more interpretable ones. So if ""I"" stands for inactive and ""A"" for active, maybe we should include that state. So Caspase_I could be ""Caspase_inactive"" and Caspase_A as ""Caspase_active"". But the guidelines also say to use context and references, and in the replacement table, both Caspase_I and Caspase_A reference CASP3, which is caspase 3. \n\nSo perhaps the correct approach is to map Caspase_I to ""CASP3_inactive"" and Caspase_A to ""CASP3_active"".

Alternatively, the `id` is already a term that might be interpretable, so maybe we should keep it as ""Caspase_I"" and ""Caspase_A"".\n\nWait, the example given was ""R"" becoming ""IL6_R"", which implies that if the `id` is a simple abbreviation, we can combine it with the reference.

They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words; I need to combine them with underscores if necessary. Also, ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones using the provided table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nThe user also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, and then refine it using references. I need to be careful here because the `name` column might not always have the right terms. I should check the references if the name is ambiguous.\n\nAnother point is considering states like ""bound"" or ""active."" These should be added as part of the term with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation or easily interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided. The equation is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK converting to c_Raf_Ras_GTP and ppMEK_ERK. The replacement table has the reactants as c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK with references MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. The products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP (RAF1) and ppMEK_ERK (MAP2K1; MAPK1).\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s break it down.\n\nFor the reactants id ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"", the references are MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. The name is empty, so I need to rely on the references. Since it\'s a reactant, it\'s probably a complex involving RAF, Ras, GTP, pMEK, and ERK. But RAF1 is the main component, so maybe just RAF1? Or perhaps a combination of components.\n\nWait, but the product is c_Raf_Ras_GTP. So maybe the reactant is the complex before something happens. The other product is ppMEK_ERK. So the reactant is the initial state, perhaps RAF1 with Ras-GTP, leading to activation of MEK and ERK.\n\nLooking at the references, RAF1 is the primary component. So maybe the reactant id maps to RAF1, and the products are the activated forms. But I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since the reactant has pMEK and ERK, maybe it\'s a phosphorylated state.\n\nWait, the user\'s example was ""R"" to ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" to ""CSF1R_L"". So perhaps I should look for receptor and ligand components. But in this case, the id is more complex.\n\nGiven the references, RAF1 is the key enzyme, so maybe the reactant is RAF1. The product c_Raf_Ras_GTP could be RAF1 bound to Ras-GTP, but since it\'s a single word, perhaps ""RAF1_RasGTP"". The other product is ppMEK_ERK, which could be ""ppMEK_ERK"" as is, since it\'s a single term.\n\nBut the user\'s guidelines say if the term is a simple abbreviation, it\'s fine. So maybe I can keep the product terms as they are.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would have three keys:\n\n- ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"" maps to ""RAF1"" because the main component is RAF1, and it\'s a complex.\n- ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"" maps to ""RAF1"" as well, but maybe ""RAF1_RasGTP"" if we consider the bound state.\n- ""ppMEK_ERK"" maps to ""ppMEK_ERK"" since it\'s already a single term.\n\nWait, but the products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP and ppMEK_ERK. The reactant is the combination. So perhaps the reactant is the initial state, and the products are the activated states.\n\nAlternatively, since the reactant has pMEK and ERK, maybe it\'s the active form, so the term should include ""active"". But the user\'s example didn\'t include that, so maybe it\'s not necessary unless specified.\n\nI think the best approach is to map each id to the primary component from the references. So, ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"" becomes ""RAF1"", ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"" becomes ""RAF1"", and ""ppMEK_ERK"" becomes ""ppMEK_ERK"".\n\nBut wait, the replacement table\'s reactants have multiple references: MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. So perhaps the reactant is a complex involving all three. But since the name is empty, I have to pick one. The main component is RAF1, so maybe just RAF1.\n\nThe products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP (RAF1) and ppMEK_ERK (MAP2K1; MAPK1). So perhaps ppMEK_ERK maps to ""MAPK1"" or ""MAP2K1"". But since the references include both, maybe it\'s better to pick one. Alternatively, since the id is ppMEK_ERK, perhaps it\'s a combination, so ""ppMEK_ERK"" as is.\n\nI think the user\'s example used the name if available, else the references. Since the name is empty, I should use the references. But RAF1 is the main one, so maybe ""RAF1"" for the reactant and product.\n\nWait, the products are two separate terms: c_Raf_Ras_GTP and ppMEK_ERK. So perhaps c_Raf_Ras_GTP is the activated RAF1, so ""RAF1_active"" or ""RAF1_RasGTP"". But the user\'s guidelines say to use the name if available, else use context. Since the name is empty, I have to use the references.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reactant is the complex, so it\'s ""RAF1"" as the main component, and the products are ""RAF1"" and ""ppMEK_ERK"".\n\nI think that\'s the best approach. So the JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"": ""RAF1"",\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"": ""RAF1"",\n  ""ppMEK_ERK"": ""ppMEK_ERK""\n}\n\nBut I\'m a bit unsure about the ppMEK_ERK. Should it be ""MAPK1"" or ""MAP2K1""? Since the references are both, maybe ""MAP2K1"" since MEK is MAP2K1.\n\nAlternatively, since the id is ppMEK_ERK, perhaps it\'s better to keep it as is, as it\'s a single term. So I\'ll go with that.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words; I need to combine them with underscores if necessary. Also, ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones using the provided table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore.

I need to be careful here because the `name` column might have abbreviations or terms that aren\'t fully interpretable on their own. I should prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column but also check the references for accuracy.\n\nIncluding states like ""bound"" or ""active"" is another consideration. If applicable, I should append these states with an underscore. However, in the given replacement table, I don\'t see any states mentioned, so I might not need to worry about that for now.\n\nIf a term is already an abbreviation and is reasonably clear, I shouldn\'t change it significantly. But in this case, the terms like ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK"" and ""pMEK_ERK"" aren\'t immediately clear, so I need to parse them.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK => c_Raf_Ras_GTP + pMEK_ERK. So the reactant is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK, and the products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK.\n\nNow, looking at the replacement table:\n\n- For the reactant `id` c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK, the references are MAPK1; RAF1; MAP2K1. The `name` is empty, so I need to rely on the references.\n\n- For the products, `id` c_Raf_Ras_GTP has a reference of RAF1. The `name` is also empty here.\n\n- The other product `id` pMEK_ERK has references MAPK1; MAP2K1.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically interpretable term.\n\nStarting with the reactant c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK. The references are MAPK1, RAF1, MAP2K1. I know that RAF1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), MEK is a MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K), and ERK is a MAP kinase (MAPK). The \'c\' probably stands for \'c-Raf\', which is RAF1.\n\nSo, c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK is likely a complex involving c-Raf (RAF1), Ras bound to GTP, MEK, and ERK.

Since the `name` column is empty, I\'ll need to construct the terms based on the references.\n\nc_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK: The references include RAF1, MAPK1, MAP2K1. RAF1 is c-Raf, MAP2K1 is MEK, MAPK1 is ERK. So perhaps this is a signaling complex. But the `id` is quite long, so maybe it\'s a specific complex. Since the `id` itself is a combination of proteins, I might not need to change it, but perhaps I can make it more interpretable. Alternatively, since the references include RAF1, maybe the term is RAF1 signaling complex. But the guidelines say to use the `name` column if possible, but here it\'s empty. So I\'ll have to use the `id` and see if I can make it a single word. Maybe c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK is too long, but perhaps it\'s a specific term. Alternatively, I could combine the proteins, but that might not be necessary. Alternatively, since the products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK, perhaps the reactant is the unphosphorylated form. But without a `name`, I think I have to leave it as is, but I\'m not sure. Maybe I should map it to a known complex name, but I don\'t have that information.

Let\'s break down c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK:\n\n- c_Raf: probably RAF1\n- Ras: Ras protein bound to GTP\n- MEK: MAP2K1\n- ERK: MAPK1\n\nSo perhaps the term is RAF1_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK. But that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, maybe it\'s a signaling pathway step, but as a single term, perhaps it\'s RAF1_MEK_ERK_complex or something. But without a specific name, it\'s hard. Maybe I should leave it as c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK since it\'s the `id` and the `name` is empty.\n\nNext, the product c_Raf_Ras_GTP. The reference is RAF1. So this is likely RAF1 bound to Ras-GTP. So the term could be RAF1_Ras_GTP.\n\nThe other product is pMEK_ERK. The references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. pMEK means phosphorylated MEK, which activates ERK.

The example didn\'t have that, so maybe it\'s not necessary here. Also, the user said if the term is simple, don\'t change it. So for MEK_ERK, since it\'s already a common term, I can leave it as is.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON would map each id to its corresponding term. So:\n\n- c_Raf_Ras_GTP becomes RAF1\n- MEK_ERK becomes MEK_ERK\n- c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK becomes RAF1_MEK_ERK\n\nI think that makes sense. I need to make sure each is a single word and accurately reflects the biological terms. I don\'t see any ambiguous terms here, so I can proceed without further changes.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` in a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words; instead, I should use underscores if necessary. Also, if a term is an abbreviation, I shouldn\'t change it unless I can make it more interpretable. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nThe user provided an equation and a replacement table. The equation is c_Raf_Ras_GTP + pMEK_ERK => c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK. The replacement table has three entries: c_Raf_Ras_GTP, pMEK_ERK, and c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK. Each has an id, name, and references.\n\nI notice that for c_Raf_Ras_GTP, the name is empty, but the reference is RAF1. Similarly, pMEK_ERK has references to MAPK1 and MAP2K1. The product\'s references include all three: MAPK1, MAP2K1, and RAF1.\n\nThe user\'s guidelines mention that if a term can be identified as a receptor or ligand, I should create a single word with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"". But in this case, the terms aren\'t R or L, so that doesn\'t apply here.\n\nI also need to consider states like ""bound"" or ""active"" and include them with an underscore. However, the terms here don\'t mention such states, so that\'s not applicable.\n\nLooking at each id:\n\n1. c_Raf_Ras_GTP: The name is empty, but the reference is RAF1. Since RAF1 is a known protein, I can map c_Raf_Ras_GTP to RAF1. It\'s a single word, so no changes needed.\n\n2. pMEK_ERK: The references are MAPK1 and MAP2K1. MAPK1 is ERK2, and MAP2K1 is MEK1. Since pMEK refers to phosphorylated MEK, but the name column is empty, I should map it to the more specific term. However, the user\'s guideline says if the name is empty, use the reference. But since there are two references, I need to pick the most appropriate. MAPK1 is ERK, so maybe pMEK_ERK maps to MAPK1. But wait, MEK is MAP2K1, so perhaps I should use that. Alternatively, since the name is empty, maybe I should look for a more interpretable term. But the user\'s guidelines say if the term is an abbreviation, it\'s fine. So pMEK_ERK is already an abbreviation, so perhaps I can leave it as is. But the reference says MAPK1 and MAP2K1, so maybe I should map it to MAPK1, which is ERK.\n\n3. c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK: The references are all three: RAF1, MAPK1, and MAP2K1. The name is empty. Since the product is a complex of RAF1, MEK, and ERK, perhaps the most accurate term would be RAF1, but that\'s just one component. Alternatively, maybe I should represent the complex as RAF1. However, since it\'s a complex, maybe I should combine the terms, but the guidelines say each term must be a single word. So perhaps RAF1 is the best choice since it\'s a single word.\n\nPutting it all together, the JSON object would map each id to RAF1, MAPK1, and RAF1 respectively. That seems consistent with the guidelines and the references provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher. They need to generate a JSON object that maps each `id` from a replacement table to a biologically interpretable term. The user has provided specific guidelines, so I need to make sure I follow them closely.\n\nFirst, I\'ll look at the guidelines. Each term must be a single word. That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words; I need to combine them with underscores if necessary. Also, ambiguous terms should be replaced with more interpretable ones using the provided table. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I need to connect them with an underscore. For example, ""R"" becomes ""IL6_R"" and ""L"" becomes ""CSF1R_L"".\n\nThe user also mentioned that sometimes a two-step process is needed: first map the `id` to the `name`, and then refine it using references. I need to be careful here because the `name` column might have abbreviations or terms that aren\'t fully interpretable on their own. I should prioritize the phrasing from the `name` column but also check the references for accuracy.\n\nIncluding states like ""bound"" or ""active"" is another consideration. If applicable, I should append these states with an underscore. However, in the given replacement table, I don\'t see any states mentioned, so I might not need to worry about that for now.\n\nIf a term is already an abbreviation and is reasonably clear, I shouldn\'t change it significantly. But in this case, the terms like ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK"" and ""pMEK_ERK"" aren\'t immediately clear, so I need to parse them.\n\nLooking at the input, the equation is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK => c_Raf_Ras_GTP + pMEK_ERK. So the reactant is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK, and the products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK.\n\nNow, looking at the replacement table:\n\n- For the reactant `id` c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK, the references are MAPK1; RAF1; MAP2K1. The `name` is empty, so I need to rely on the references.\n\n- For the products, `id` c_Raf_Ras_GTP has a reference of RAF1. The `name` is also empty here.\n\n- The other product `id` pMEK_ERK has references MAPK1; MAP2K1.\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a biologically interpretable term.\n\nStarting with the reactant c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK. The references are MAPK1, RAF1, MAP2K1. I know that RAF1 is a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K), MEK is a MAP kinase kinase (MAP2K), and ERK is a MAP kinase (MAPK). The \'c\' probably stands for \'c-Raf\', which is RAF1.\n\nSo, c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK is likely a complex involving c-Raf (RAF1), Ras bound to GTP, MEK, and ERK. Since the equation breaks it down into c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK, perhaps the reactant is the unphosphorylated form, and the products are the active forms.\n\nBut for the JSON mapping, I need to find a single word for each `id`. Since the `name` column is empty, I\'ll need to construct the terms based on the references.\n\nc_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK: The references include RAF1, MAPK1, MAP2K1. RAF1 is c-Raf, MAP2K1 is MEK, MAPK1 is ERK. So perhaps the term is RAF1 bound to MEK and ERK, but since it\'s a complex, maybe RAF1_MEK_ERK. But the equation shows that it\'s broken into c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK. So the reactant is likely the inactive form of the complex.\n\nc_Raf_Ras_GTP: The reference is RAF1, so this is likely the active form of c-Raf bound to Ras-GTP.\n\npMEK_ERK: The references are MAPK1 (ERK) and MAP2K1 (MEK). Since it\'s pMEK, it\'s phosphorylated MEK bound to ERK.\n\nBut the user wants each `id` mapped to a single word. So for c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK, since it\'s a complex of RAF1, MEK, and ERK, I can combine them as RAF1_MEK_ERK.\n\nFor c_Raf_Ras_GTP, since it\'s RAF1 bound to Ras-GTP, perhaps RAF1_RasGTP.\n\nFor pMEK_ERK, it\'s phosphorylated MEK bound to ERK, so maybe pMEK_ERK.\n\nWait, but the `id` is already pMEK_ERK, so if the term is reasonably interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it. But the user\'s guidelines say to replace ambiguous terms. So perhaps I should map it to a more precise term, like MAP2K1_phosphorylated_ERK.\n\nBut considering the guidelines, if the term is already an abbreviation, like pMEK, it\'s okay to leave it as is. So maybe just pMEK_ERK.\n\nPutting it all together:\n\n- c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK maps to RAF1_MEK_ERK\n- c_Raf_Ras_GTP maps to RAF1_RasGTP\n- pMEK_ERK maps to pMEK_ERK\n\nBut wait, the user\'s example used underscores, like IL6_R. So perhaps for c_Raf_Ras_GTP, it\'s cRaf_Ras_GTP, but since the user prefers single words, maybe cRafRasGTP.\n\nBut the user\'s example used underscores, so perhaps better to use underscores.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the names are more accurately represented by their gene symbols. RAF1 is c-Raf, MAP2K1 is MEK, MAPK1 is ERK.\n\nSo, c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK could be RAF1_MEK_ERK.\n\nBut the equation shows that it\'s broken into c_Raf_Ras_GTP and pMEK_ERK. So the reactant is the complex before activation, and the products are the active parts.\n\nSo, for the JSON:\n\n{\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK"": ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"",\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"": ""RAF1_RasGTP"",\n  ""pMEK_ERK"": ""pMEK_ERK""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not sure if RAF1_RasGTP is a standard term. Alternatively, it could be RAF1_bound_RasGTP, but that\'s two words. Alternatively, maybe just RAF1_GTP.\n\nBut according to the guidelines, it should be a single word. So perhaps RAF1_GTP_Ras.\n\nWait, but the `id` is c_Raf_Ras_GTP, so perhaps it\'s better to map it to RAF1_RasGTP.\n\nAlternatively, since c-Raf is RAF1, and it\'s bound to Ras-GTP, the term could be RAF1_RasGTP.\n\nSimilarly, pMEK_ERK is MEK phosphorylated and bound to ERK, so pMEK_ERK.\n\nSo the final JSON would be:\n\n{\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_MEK_ERK"": ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"",\n  ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"": ""RAF1_RasGTP"",\n  ""pMEK_ERK"": ""pMEK_ERK""\n}\n\nBut I\'m not entirely sure if these are the most accurate terms. Maybe RAF1_MEK_ERK is too vague. Alternatively, since the complex involves c-Raf, MEK, and ERK, perhaps it\'s better to write it as RAF1_MEK_ERK_complex, but that\'s more than one word. So I\'ll stick with RAF1_MEK_ERK.\n\nI think this is a reasonable mapping based on the references provided.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

These should be added as part of the term with an underscore, like ""IL6_R_active"". If the term is already an abbreviation or easily interpretable, I shouldn\'t change it much.\n\nNow, looking at the input provided. The equation is c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK converting to c_Raf_Ras_GTP and ppMEK_ERK. The replacement table has the reactants as c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK with references MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. The products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP (RAF1) and ppMEK_ERK (MAP2K1; MAPK1).\n\nSo, I need to map each `id` to a term. Let\'s break it down.\n\nFor the reactants id ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"", the references are MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. The name is empty, so I need to rely on the references. Since it\'s a reactant, it\'s probably a complex involving RAF, Ras, GTP, pMEK, and ERK. But RAF1 is the main component, so maybe just RAF1? Or perhaps a combination of components.\n\nWait, but the product is c_Raf_Ras_GTP. So maybe the reactant is the complex before something happens. The other product is ppMEK_ERK. So the reactant is the initial state, perhaps RAF1 with Ras-GTP, leading to activation of MEK and ERK.\n\nLooking at the references for the reactant: MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. So, MAPK1 is ERK, MAP2K1 is MEK. So, the reactant might be a complex involving RAF1, Ras, GTP, and the inactive forms of MEK and ERK.\n\nThe products are c_Raf_Ras_GTP (which is just the activated RAF-Ras-GTP complex) and ppMEK_ERK, which are the active forms of MEK and ERK.\n\nSo, for the reactants id, perhaps it\'s the initial state where MEK and ERK are not yet active. So, the term would be RAF1 with inactive MEK and ERK. But how to represent that as a single word?\n\nMaybe ""RAF1Inactive"" or something, but the guidelines prefer underscores for parts. Alternatively, since it\'s a complex, maybe ""RAF1_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERKInactive"". But that\'s a bit long. Alternatively, considering that in the products, ppMEK_ERK is active, so the reactant is the inactive form.\n\nWait, but the user said to consider states like ""active"" or ""bound"". So perhaps the reactant is RAF1 bound to inactive MEK and ERK, so ""RAF1_MEKInactive_ERKInactive"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure. Alternatively, since the products are active, perhaps the reactant is the inactive state, so ""RAF1Inactive"".\n\nBut the references include RAF1, MAP2K1 (MEK), and MAPK1 (ERK). So maybe the reactant is a complex involving RAF1, MEK, and ERK in their inactive states.\n\nAlternatively, since the product is ppMEK_ERK, which is active, perhaps the reactant is the inactive form, so RAF1 with inactive MEK and ERK.\n\nBut I\'m not sure how to represent that concisely. Maybe ""RAF1Inactive_MEKInactive_ERKInactive""? But that\'s too long and not a single word.\n\nWait, the user\'s example was ""IL6_R"" for R. So perhaps I can model this similarly. Since the id is ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"", maybe it\'s a complex, so ""cRAF_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"". But ""cRAF"" might not be a standard term.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it\'s better to use the main components. RAF1 is the main component, so ""RAF1"".\n\nWait, the product is ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"", which maps to RAF1. So maybe the reactant is the same complex, but including pMEK and ERK.\n\nHmm, perhaps the reactant is RAF1 bound to Ras-GTP, pMEK, and ERK, but in an inactive state. So maybe ""RAF1_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERKInactive"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the reactant is just ""RAF1"" since the product is ""RAF1"".\n\nWait, looking at the replacement table, the reactants id is ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP_pMEK_ERK"", and the name is empty, but the references are MAPK1, MAP2K1, RAF1. So perhaps the main component is RAF1, so the term would be ""RAF1"".\n\nBut the product is ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"", which maps to RAF1. So maybe the reactant is ""RAF1"" as well, but that seems odd because it\'s the same id mapping to the same term. Alternatively, maybe the reactant is the complex, so ""RAF1_Ras_GTP"".\n\nBut I\'m a bit confused. Maybe I should look for the simplest approach. Since the product is ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"" mapping to RAF1, perhaps the reactant is the same but including MEK and ERK in an inactive state.\n\nBut I\'m not sure. Maybe I should just map the reactants id to ""RAF1"" since that\'s one of the references, and the products as ""RAF1"" and ""ERK"".\n\nWait, no, the product ppMEK_ERK maps to MAP2K1 and MAPK1, which are MEK and ERK. So perhaps the reactant is RAF1 with inactive MEK and ERK, so ""RAF1_MEKInactive_ERKInactive"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure if that\'s accurate. Alternatively, perhaps the reactant is just ""RAF1"" because it\'s the main component, and the rest are part of the process.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the reactant is a complex, maybe ""RAF1_Ras_GTP"" but that\'s the same as the product, which doesn\'t make sense.\n\nHmm, I\'m stuck here. Maybe I should look for the main components. The reactant has references to RAF1, MEK, and ERK, so perhaps it\'s a complex involving all three. So the term would be ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"".\n\nBut the user\'s example used underscores to connect parts. So maybe ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"".\n\nBut the product is ""RAF1"" and ""ERK"", so perhaps the reactant is the complex of all three.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the reactant is ""RAF1Inactive"" and the product is ""RAF1Active"".\n\nBut I\'m not sure. I think I need to make a decision here. Given the references, I\'ll map the reactants id to ""RAF1"" since it\'s the main component, and the products are ""RAF1"" and ""ERK"".\n\nWait, but the products are ""c_Raf_Ras_GTP"" mapping to RAF1 and ""ppMEK_ERK"" mapping to ERK and MEK.

I think I\'ll go with ""RAF1"" for the reactants id since it\'s the main component, and the products are ""RAF1"" and ""ERK"".\n\nWait, but the product is ""ppMEK_ERK"", which maps to ERK and MEK. So perhaps the reactant is the complex with inactive MEK and ERK.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the reactant is ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"".\n\nI think I\'ll settle on ""RAF1_MEK_ERK"" for the reactants id.', 'Okay, so I\'m trying to help this user who\'s an excellent biological researcher.

That means I can\'t have spaces or multiple words; I need to find concise terms. They also mention replacing ambiguous terms with more specific ones, using context and references. If it\'s a receptor or ligand, I should connect them with an underscore, like ""IL6_R"" or ""CSF1R_L"". \n\nLooking at the input, there\'s an equation and a replacement table. The equation is CDKN1A => Nil; Akt_pS473, Akt_pS473, CDKN1A.

The guideline says if it\'s an abbreviation and reasonably interpretable, leave it as is. So CDKN1A stays.\n\n2. **Nil**: The role is products, name is Nil, no references. Since Nil is a term indicating nothing, it\'s straightforward. It\'s not ambiguous, so it remains Nil.\n\n3. **Akt_pS473**: This appears in the modifiers role, with the same name and references pointing to AKT1.
